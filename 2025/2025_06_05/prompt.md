I heard about an old Irish story where a boy got knowledge from a magic salmon. Do you know of this story and can you give me a summary of it and its background? What surprised me is that the story mentioned that as well as training to be a strong physical warrior, the boy had to also train to be a good "poet"... is this a one of thing or is it a common and well accepted truth in Irish mythology. Are there other cultures around the world that share this quality of boy warriors needing to be both physically accomplished but intellectually able also? It seems a bit contrary to the sort of Roman image of a warrior I am accustomed to. If this is really a thing can you suggest some reasons or even give me some practical examples of why it would be advantageous for a warrior to be "skilled" in poetry? Do you think aspects of this might apply in the modern world?
