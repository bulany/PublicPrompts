You're thinking of the story of Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) and the Salmon of Knowledge! This is one of the most famous tales in Irish mythology.

**The Story:**
Young Fionn was sent to study under the poet Finnéces, who had been trying for seven years to catch the legendary Salmon of Knowledge that lived in the River Boyne. According to prophecy, whoever ate this salmon would gain all the world's knowledge. When Finnéces finally caught the fish, he instructed Fionn to cook it but warned him not to eat any. While cooking, Fionn burned his thumb on the salmon and instinctively sucked it to ease the pain - thus gaining the salmon's wisdom. From then on, whenever Fionn needed knowledge, he would suck his thumb and receive insight.

**The Warrior-Poet Tradition:**
This combination of martial and intellectual prowess wasn't unusual at all in Celtic culture. The *fianna* (warrior bands) that Fionn later led were expected to master both combat skills and poetic arts. To join the fianna, candidates had to demonstrate they could compose poetry on the spot while being pursued through the forest. This reflects the Celtic belief that true leadership required both physical courage and intellectual sophistication.

**Similar Traditions Worldwide:**
This warrior-scholar ideal appears across many cultures:

- **Japanese samurai** were expected to master both *bu* (martial arts) and *bun* (literature/arts), following the principle of *bunbu-ryōdō*
- **Medieval European knights** ideally combined chivalric combat skills with courtly accomplishments like poetry and music
- **Ancient Greek heroes** like Achilles were tutored in both warfare and the arts - Achilles was taught by the centaur Chiron to play the lyre alongside wielding weapons
- **Islamic warrior traditions** emphasized that great military leaders should also be scholars and poets
- **Norse culture** valued *skalds* (warrior-poets) who could both fight and compose complex verse

**Practical Advantages of Poetic Skills for Warriors:**

The combination made tactical sense. Poetry required mental agility, pattern recognition, and the ability to think quickly under pressure - all crucial in battle. Memorization skills needed for oral poetry helped warriors remember complex battle formations and strategic knowledge. Rhetoric and wordplay were essential for diplomacy, inspiring troops, and psychological warfare through boasts and taunts that could demoralize enemies.

Additionally, in cultures without widespread literacy, poets served as living libraries, preserving historical knowledge, genealogies, laws, and cultural wisdom that informed military and political decisions.

**Modern Applications:**
Today's military leadership still benefits from these principles. Modern officers need strategic thinking, cultural intelligence for international operations, communication skills for media relations and troop morale, and the ability to process complex information quickly. The warrior-poet ideal recognizes that the most effective leaders combine physical courage with intellectual depth, emotional intelligence, and cultural sophistication.

The Celtic tradition understood something profound: that true strength comes not just from the sword arm, but from the trained mind that knows when and how to use it.
