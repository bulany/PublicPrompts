In the 80s or 90s you had the Amiga which was an affordable computer with great digital music making abilities. 
Then a bit later on I heard about BeOS which seemed to be the only operating system trying to be designed to be good for music making.
What did these operating and hardware systems have in common and how were they different from other things around at the same time.
What is a "real time os" and were Amiga OS and BeOS "real time os"'s?
Is there any worthy successor to Amiga OS and BeOS in terms of a great system for experimenting with computer music.
Can you suggest any good "platforms" (software and hardware combos) for affordable (accessible) development of nice music things, like new kinds of samplers and digital instruments?
Whatever happened to DSP chips?
What are the limits of using web and browser based solutions (e.g. in terms of latency)?
