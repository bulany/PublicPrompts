This is a great cluster of questions that touches on the history, architecture, and future of digital music platforms. Let’s break it all down step by step:

---

## 🎛️ **Amiga OS vs BeOS – Common Ground and Differences**

### ✨ **What they had in common**

* **Media-centric focus**: Both were designed with multimedia (graphics, sound) in mind.
* **Efficient use of hardware**: They could do a lot with limited resources.
* **Low latency**: Particularly important for music and video.
* **Responsive UIs**: Both emphasized fast, smooth user interaction (pre-emptive multitasking, fast message passing).

### 🎹 **Amiga OS (1985 onward)**

* **Hardware**: Had custom chips like *Paula* for sound, which supported 4-channel 8-bit PCM audio — revolutionary for home computers at the time.
* **OS**: Not a real-time OS, but **closer to bare metal** and very efficient. Preemptive multitasking was supported in the early 80s!
* **Strengths**: Tracker music (MODs), sound hacking, demoscene. Low CPU usage due to hardware audio mixing.
* **Limitations**: No memory protection, no proper modern audio routing or driver models.

### 🎧 **BeOS (1996 onward)**

* **OS**: Designed from scratch for multimedia. Real-time *ish* — **low latency was a priority**, with a multi-threaded architecture and a 64-bit journaling file system.
* **Audio architecture**: Everything was asynchronous and multithreaded — excellent for audio and video.
* **Strengths**: True multithreading, media kits, and audio processing pipelines.
* **Limitations**: Commercial failure, niche hardware support, development stagnated quickly.

## 🕒 **What is a Real-Time OS (RTOS)?**

* An RTOS guarantees **timely execution** of tasks, often within **hard or soft deadlines**.
* Important for:

  * Audio DSP (e.g. a synth voice needs to be processed every X ms).
  * Robotics, aerospace, and embedded systems.
* RTOS traits:

  * Deterministic scheduling.
  * Interrupt handling.
  * Minimal jitter.

### ❌ Amiga OS and BeOS were **not true RTOSs**, but:

* **Amiga OS**: Very close to the hardware, fast, cooperative and preemptive multitasking — great for hacking and low-latency audio.
* **BeOS**: Designed for low-latency media, not deterministic real-time, but extremely fast and responsive.

## 🔁 Successors to Amiga OS and BeOS

### 🧵 **Haiku OS** (BeOS successor)

* Open-source continuation of BeOS.
* Retains the same multimedia-first architecture.
* Has some promise, but limited adoption and driver support.

### 🐧 **Linux with PREEMPT\_RT**

* Real-time Linux patches make Linux suitable for audio production.
* JACK audio server + ALSA/PipeWire → low-latency audio.
* Popular in pro-audio (Ardour, Pure Data, SuperCollider, etc.)
* Raspberry Pi can run Linux + JACK for real-time musical systems.

### 🧠 **Modern embedded platforms**

* **Bela.io** (BeagleBone + RT patches) – very low latency, great for physical instrument building.
* **Axoloti** – DSP board with patchable software.
* **Organelle** – portable musical instrument running Pure Data.

## 🔍 What happened to DSP chips?

### 🧬 Then:

* Dedicated **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)** chips like the Motorola 56k were everywhere (soundcards, synths).
* Required to offload intensive real-time audio processing from slower CPUs.

### ⚙️ Now:

* CPUs (even mobile ones) are fast enough to do a lot of DSP tasks.
* SIMD (e.g., AVX, NEON) instructions on CPUs blur the line.
* DSPs still exist in **phones**, **audio interfaces**, and **hearing aids**, but are less visible.
* Modern equivalents: GPU compute, FPGA, and ARM DSP cores.

## 🌐 Limits of Web and Browser-Based Audio (Web Audio API, etc.)

### ✅ Pros:

* Easy access for users (no install).
* Great for prototyping and education.
* Web Audio API provides synthesis, effects, spatial audio.

### ❌ Limitations:

* **Latency**: Can’t compete with native apps. Can range from 20–150ms.
* **No true real-time**: Garbage collection, thread scheduling unpredictability.
* **Audio thread in browser is not hard real-time**.
* **MIDI support** is improving, but still fragile.

> 🧠 Tip: Web-based audio tools are great for learning, UI prototyping, and *some* performance. But if you're building a serious instrument or DAW, you'll hit latency and processing bottlenecks fast.

## 🎯 Final Recommendations

If you're into making new kinds of samplers or instruments:

1. **Start prototyping in the browser** with Web Audio + Tone.js or Gibberwocky.
2. **Move to Pure Data or SuperCollider** when you need expressive control and better timing.
3. **Use Bela or Raspberry Pi** for real hardware and ultra-low-latency audio DSP.
4. Consider **VCV Rack** if you're modular-inclined.
5. For code-savvy DSP: **Faust**, **JUCE**, or **Rust + CPAL** can help you write real synths and audio apps.
