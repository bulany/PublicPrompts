Maybe in the late 80s or early 90s I remember someone telling me a story about skydiving. He said that someone had calculated that if enough people got together and held each other in a certain falling formation, their terminal velocity would be so slow that none of them would actually need to pull a parachute - they would just land on the ground gently... I guess like a human snowflake.
Do you know if someone actually did do these calculations or ever attempt anything like this?
What do you think of this kind of idea?
Would it be possible?
How many people would you need and could you explain very simply (and for someone who is not that good at maths) how you might go about calculating something like this?
If the people were all wearing wingsuits would it change the calculation? Would you need less people?
