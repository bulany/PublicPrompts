I don't recall any documented calculations or attempts at creating a "human snowflake" formation like this, though it's a fascinating thought experiment that combines physics with some creative thinking about skydiving!

Let me search for any information about this concept or similar experiments:Let me search more specifically for large formation skydiving records:I couldn't find any documented calculations or attempts at the specific "human snowflake" concept you described. The searches reveal impressive formation skydiving records - the current world record is a 400-person formation that was held for 4.3 seconds - but these were still standard skydives where everyone used parachutes.

The physics behind this idea are quite interesting though! Let me break down why this concept faces some fundamental challenges:

**The Basic Physics Problem:**
Terminal velocity happens when air resistance equals gravitational force. For a single person, this occurs at around 120 mph in a belly-down position. The key insight is that while you can increase air resistance by making the formation larger, you're also adding more weight (more people = more mass being pulled down by gravity).

**Simple Calculation Approach:**
The terminal velocity formula is: v = √(2mg/ρAC)
Where:
- m = mass (total weight of all people)
- g = gravity
- ρ = air density  
- A = cross-sectional area (how big your "snowflake" looks from below)
- C = drag coefficient (how "draggy" your shape is)

**The Challenge:**
If you double the number of people, you double the mass, but you don't necessarily double the effective drag area. People can't spread out infinitely - there are practical limits to how wide a formation can be while still maintaining structural integrity in freefall.

**Rough Estimation:**
To get terminal velocity slow enough for a safe landing (maybe 10-15 mph like a parachute), you'd need to increase drag dramatically while minimizing added weight. Even if you could somehow arrange hundreds of people in an impossibly wide, perfectly flat formation, the math doesn't work out favorably because mass scales more directly than effective drag area.

**With Wingsuits:**
Wingsuits would definitely help! They dramatically increase each person's surface area and drag coefficient. A wingsuit can slow someone from 120 mph to around 25-30 mph in forward flight. With enough wingsuit flyers in a carefully designed formation, you might get closer to a survivable landing speed, but you'd still likely need an impractically large number of people - probably in the thousands.

The concept shows creative thinking about physics, but the square-cube law (as you scale up, volume/mass increases faster than surface area) works against making it practical. It's a fascinating thought experiment though!
