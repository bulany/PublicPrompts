That's a *fascinating* idea — and one that sounds like something you'd hear in a thrilling campfire story or a "what if" physics class.

## Let’s explore it in steps:

### ❓**Did anyone actually calculate or attempt this?**

As far as **real-life attempts** go:

* **No known group** has ever tried to land *without parachutes* in a massive human formation.
* There **have been stunts** with individuals landing without a parachute:

  * **Luke Aikins (2016)** jumped from 25,000 feet and landed safely in a giant net, *without a parachute*. This required **precise control, planning, and technology**.
  * Other daredevils have used **wingsuits and engineered devices** like foam pads or custom-made wings to slow down enough to survive — but even these are very dangerous.

As for **scientific calculations**, there’s no widely documented paper or study that suggests a large human formation can land safely without parachutes. It sounds more like a **myth or a thought experiment** — but it opens a fun physics discussion!

### 🧠**Is the idea *possible*?**

Short answer: **No, not with current physics and biology.**

Here’s why:

* The **terminal velocity** of a falling human belly-down (like in skydiving) is about **120 mph (200 km/h)**.
* If you **link a bunch of people**, you **increase the total mass**, which wants to fall faster...
* But you also **increase the surface area**, which slows you down.

That’s the key: **falling speed depends on both mass and air resistance**.

To land safely, you need to **reduce the terminal velocity to around 10–12 mph (15–20 km/h)** — about the speed someone falls from a second-story window and might *survive with injury*.

To *land gently*, you’d need to fall even slower. That’s **very hard** using just human bodies and air resistance — **even with dozens or hundreds of people**.

---

### 🧮**Simple explanation: how would you calculate this?**

Here’s a really simplified breakdown (no math needed):

1. **Terminal velocity** depends on:

   * How heavy you are (mass).
   * How much surface area you present to the air (drag).
   * The drag coefficient (how “aerodynamic” or not your shape is).
   * The density of the air.

2. The formula is roughly:

   $$
   V_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
   $$

   Where:

   * $V_t$ = terminal velocity
   * $m$ = mass
   * $g$ = gravity
   * $\rho$ = air density
   * $A$ = area
   * $C_d$ = drag coefficient

3. If you **make a large shape** like a giant human snowflake, you **increase area A** but also **increase mass m**.
   Unfortunately, the increase in mass tends to win — **so the group would still fall dangerously fast**.

4. To land safely, you'd need to **increase drag far more** than what people can provide with their bodies alone.

### 🪂**Would wingsuits help?**

Absolutely — **wingsuits increase surface area and drag** dramatically.
They also **convert downward motion into forward glide**, allowing for controlled landings *with parachutes*.

But:

* Even the **best wingsuiters still need parachutes** to land safely.
* They can glide at 100–160 mph horizontally, but they’re still falling vertically at 25–50 mph — **not safe for landing**.

Wingsuits would **help reduce terminal velocity**, but not enough to remove parachutes entirely — **even with many people**.

---

### 🧮**How many people would you need?**

To reduce terminal velocity to safe levels using just human mass and area? Realistically:

* The number would be **impractically huge** — maybe **thousands**, arranged in a **perfect shape**, and still might not work.
* They’d have to create something like a **giant flexible human parachute**, and the biomechanics of **holding on during descent** would be another major challenge.
* Also: how do you land **all at once** without people underneath getting crushed?

So in short: **cool idea, fun physics**, but **not practical or survivable** with what we know about human physiology and air drag.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

* The story you heard was probably a **thought experiment**, not a real plan.
* It’s **not physically feasible** to land safely just by linking people together.
* **Wingsuits help**, but still need parachutes.
* That said, it’s a **great way to think about air resistance, terminal velocity, and group physics!**
