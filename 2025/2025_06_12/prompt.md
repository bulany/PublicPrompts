Imagine you and a group of about 12 people (some you know and some you don't) have been snowed in to a remote cabin. 
Its been several days and while there is plenty of food, firewood and other basic supplies, the snow keeps falling and no one knows when things will return to normal. 
There is a bit of 'cabin-fever' starting to set in. You haven't said or done much during this whole ordeal, you've been pretty quiet, but now the general morale is starting to falter. 
You decide to act. 
In the common area there is a piano that has been sitting in the corner unused this whole time. No one suspects that you play but one morning when the snow is still falling outside and the wind is howling, and as I said, people are starting to get a bit desperate, you quietly walk over to the piano, lift the lid and play the most amazing music that lifts peoples spirits and brings everyone together. 
What would be your top 3 choices for a piece of music on this occasion?
