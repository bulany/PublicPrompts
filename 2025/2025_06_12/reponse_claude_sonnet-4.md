What a vivid and moving scenario! The weight of that moment - everyone's spirits low, the storm raging outside, and then the unexpected gift of music to lift everyone up. I can almost feel the hush that would fall over the room as the first notes ring out.

For this situation, I'd want pieces that are both emotionally powerful and accessible - music that could speak to everyone regardless of their musical background. Here are my three choices:

**1. "Clair de Lune" by Debussy** - There's something about this piece that feels like hope breaking through darkness. It starts gently, almost tentatively, then builds with such beautiful, flowing melodies that seem to wash away tension. It captures both the melancholy of our situation and the promise that storms eventually pass. The way it moves from introspective to soaring feels perfect for lifting spirits gradually.

**2. "The Way You Look Tonight" (Jerome Kern)** - After the classical piece has worked its magic, I'd shift to something warmer and more familiar. This jazz standard has such an optimistic swing to it, and people might start humming along or even swaying. It's the kind of music that reminds you of good times and human connection - exactly what we'd need in that isolated cabin.

**3. "Hey Jude" by The Beatles** - For the finale, something everyone would know and could eventually join in on. Starting with just the piano, letting the "na na na nanananana" build until the whole room is singing together. By the end, we wouldn't just be individual strangers stuck together - we'd be a community that had shared something beautiful.

Each piece would serve a different purpose in pulling everyone back from that edge of despair and into something resembling joy.
