What a powerful moment to step into—a quiet act of hope through music. If I had to choose just three pieces to play in that setting, I'd go for a progression that meets people where they are emotionally, then gently pulls them toward warmth, unity, and uplift.

### 🎹 1. **“Spiegel im Spiegel” by Arvo Pärt**

*Why:* It's minimal, meditative, and hauntingly beautiful. The repetitive simplicity creates a feeling of stillness and safety—a mirror reflecting each listener’s mood without judgment. In that cabin, it would ease tension and allow people to breathe.

### 🎹 2. **“Clair de Lune” by Claude Debussy**

*Why:* Universally loved, it feels like moonlight on snow. Familiar yet transcendent, it would gently stir emotions and memories, inviting quiet conversation or even tears—the kind that release pressure and bond people. A tender reminder of beauty, even in isolation.

### 🎹 3. **A medley or improvisation around “Let It Be” by The Beatles**

*Why:* After classical stillness and emotional resonance, this is where connection blooms. Maybe I’d start soft and soulful, then build up as others recognize it—something they might hum or sing along to. It’s a simple message, but one of peace and collective hope.

Each piece has a different role:

* **Spiegel im Spiegel** says: *“You are not alone in this silence.”*
* **Clair de Lune** says: *“Look how much beauty still exists.”*
* **Let It Be** says: *“We’ll get through this—together.”*

Would you want your own set to lean more classical, more modern, or even folksy?
