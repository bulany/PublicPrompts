I have heard that if you are developing a skill like playing the piano, trying to improve your flexibility or even body building then taking breaks and giving your body and mind time to rest is really important (as important as actually working on the skills you are trying to learn).
Do you think this is true?
Can you think of a simple experiment that I could use to prove this to myself?
I find it fairly easy to set myself a goal like: "play 15 minutes of piano everyday", and find it fairly easy to stick to when I'm religious about doing it everyday, but if I stop for a day I find it harder to get back into the routine again. 
But if I understand correctly doing 15 minutes of piano *every single day* would not be as effective for skill development as regularly having some days wher you don't play. 
Am I understanding this principle correctly?
As I mentioned it would be great to have an experiment I could perform (on myself) to back this up, but maybe also some kind of pretty irrefutable anecdotes... like I heard someone say that the Beatles really only became a band (in Germany??) or somewhere where they had a break or had regular breaks?
