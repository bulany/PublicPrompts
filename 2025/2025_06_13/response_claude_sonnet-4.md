Yes, you're absolutely right about the importance of rest for skill development. This principle is well-established across multiple domains - from motor learning to strength training to cognitive skills. The key mechanisms are:

**Consolidation**: Your brain literally rewires itself during rest periods, strengthening neural pathways formed during practice. Sleep is particularly crucial for this.

**Recovery**: Physical skills need time for muscles and joints to adapt and repair.

**Avoiding overuse**: Constant repetition without breaks can lead to fatigue, poor form, and even injury.

**Fresh perspective**: Breaks prevent you from getting stuck in bad habits or mental ruts.

However, your concern about routine disruption is valid. The sweet spot is typically practicing most days with planned rest days, rather than daily practice or completely irregular practice.

## Simple Self-Experiment

Here's a concrete experiment you could try with piano:

**Setup**: Choose two similar pieces or exercises at your current skill level.
- Piece A: Practice 15 minutes every single day for 4 weeks
- Piece B: Practice 15 minutes for 5 days, then take 2 days off (repeat this cycle for 4 weeks)

**Measurement**: Record yourself playing both pieces at the start and end, focusing on accuracy, smoothness, and tempo. You could even count mistakes or use a metronome to track tempo consistency.

## Research-Backed Anecdotes

The Beatles example you mentioned isn't quite right, but there's a famous study that perfectly illustrates this principle: researchers taught people to type a sequence on a keyboard. One group practiced continuously, another had breaks. The break group showed significant improvement *during* the rest periods - their brains were literally practicing while they rested.

Elite athletes universally use periodization (planned rest cycles), and studies on motor learning consistently show that distributed practice (with breaks) beats massed practice (continuous) for long-term retention and skill development.

Your instinct about routine disruption is smart though - maybe frame it as "6 days on, 1 day rest" rather than sporadic breaks.
