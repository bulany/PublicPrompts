A wife has stuck a handwritten note above the sink in the kitchen where the family wash the dishes.
The note describes care instructions for a new cast iron fry pan that the wife paid a fair bit of money.
The instructions are several bits of advice that I'm assuming are an attempt to prolong the useful life of the fry pan including things like: 
 - No cold water on a hot pan
 - Don't use metal spoons
 - Don't clean with the scouring side of the sponge
 - Don't put in the dishwasher
 - Put a bit of oil on the pan after washing it before you store it away.

The nuclear family consists also of a husband and two children under the age of 7. 
The husband was thinking it would be a good idea to also have a list of care instructions for preserving and maintaining healthy and funcitonal relationships between the members of the family.
Could you draft what a set of care instructions might look like for a family?
I'm imagining things like "avoid blaming and accusations"... "end each conversation with ? before leaving" etc.
It might be nice to have some direct and almost humurous analogs of the cleaning and care instructions of the fry pan.
Do you think posting a note like this above the sink is a good idea and or reminder for people in the household? Surely if the family is taking such care of a frypan, they should take equal or more care of the relationships in the household right?
