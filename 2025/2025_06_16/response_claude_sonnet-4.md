# Family Care Instructions
*Handle with love - we're worth the investment too!*

## Daily Care
- **No harsh words on heated emotions** - Let tempers cool before discussing problems
- **Don't use sharp criticism** - Choose gentle words that build up rather than tear down  
- **Avoid the rough side of your tongue** - Speak kindly, even when frustrated
- **No putting family members through the wringer** - Don't overwhelm each other with demands
- **Apply a little appreciation after every interaction** - End conversations with something positive before storing the memory away

## Special Maintenance  
- **Season regularly with quality time** - Like oil protects the pan, attention protects relationships
- **Handle temperature changes gradually** - When someone's upset, don't jump straight to solutions
- **Clean up messes while they're fresh** - Address hurt feelings quickly before they harden
- **Store in a safe, dry place** - Everyone needs their own space to recharge

## Warning Signs
- **Rust spots** = Resentments building up (needs immediate attention!)
- **Food sticking** = Communication breaking down (time to re-season with patience)
- **Warping** = Someone feeling stretched too thin (redistribute the load)

## Remember
*With proper care, this family will last for generations and only get better with time.*

*If you wouldn't treat the cast iron this way, don't treat each other this way either.*
