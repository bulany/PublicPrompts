Absolutely — it's a wonderful and gently humorous idea to put a set of “family care instructions” next to the pan instructions! Not only does it acknowledge the emotional labor often tied to family life (much like the care of a beloved kitchen tool), it also brings emotional intelligence into the daily routine in a playful but meaningful way.

Posting a note like this can be a great reminder — especially if it’s warm, clear, and lightly funny. It makes the invisible work of maintaining connection *visible*, and signals to kids (and adults!) that relationships need care, just like cast iron.

### 🧼 *"CARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS FAMILY"* 🧼

(Handle with love. Not dishwasher safe.)

* 🧊 **Don’t pour cold words onto a hot heart.**
  Let tempers cool before talking it out. (Yes, this includes grown-ups too.)

* 🍴 **Use soft tools.**
  No sharp tones, no metal spoons of sarcasm. Gentle words get better results.

* 🧽 **Avoid the scouring side.**
  Criticism hurts. Try curiosity, not scrubbing. Ask: *"What happened?"* instead of *"Why did you do that?"*

* 🚫 **Not dishwasher-safe.**
  Relationships don’t clean themselves. Everyone contributes. Don’t expect one person to do all the rinsing.

* 💧 **Rinse and oil daily.**
  A little kindness at the end of the day goes a long way. Hugs, high-fives, or a “thank you” help seal the love in.

* ⏳ **Soak in patience, not silence.**
  If someone’s quiet, don’t assume. Ask gently. Let things soften.

* ❓ **Always end conversations with a question, not a door.**
  Try: “Are we okay?” or “Need a hug?” before walking away.

* 🌦 **Accept some rust.**
  We all mess up. That’s what seasoning (and forgiveness) is for. Keep tending.

* 🔁 **Re-season regularly.**
  Do something fun together. Laughter keeps the surface non-stick.

> *(Right next to the sacred skillet.)*

### Why this works:

* **It brings daily mindfulness to relationships** — just like a pan is a daily object, family interaction is constant.
* **Kids can absorb emotional tools early**, especially if the tone is fun and framed like a game or metaphor.
* **It encourages equity** — care is everyone’s job, not just one person’s emotional burden.
