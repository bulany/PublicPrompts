The most widely accepted technique for memorizing phone numbers is **chunking combined with the Method of Loci (memory palace)** or **chunking with mnemonic associations**. However, since you specifically want to test spaced repetition, I'll recommend a approach that incorporates this principle.

## Recommended Technique: Chunked Spaced Repetition

**Method**: Break each 10-digit number into meaningful chunks (typically 3-3-4 pattern), create associations for each chunk, then use spaced repetition intervals.

For example: 555-123-4567
- 555 = "Triple nickel" 
- 123 = "Counting up"
- 4567 = "Consecutive climb"

## Experimental Design

**Materials needed**: 
- 3-4 phone numbers to memorize
- Simple tracking sheet or app
- Timer

**Daily routine (4-5 minutes)**:
1. **Review phase** (2-3 min): Test recall of numbers using spaced intervals
2. **Practice phase** (1-2 min): Work on problem areas
3. **Log results** (30 sec): Record success rate

**Spaced repetition schedule**:
- Day 1: Learn number, test immediately
- Day 2: Test (24 hours later)
- Day 4: Test (48 hours later) 
- Day 7: Test (3 days later)
- Day 14: Test (1 week later)
- Day 21: Final test (1 week later)

**Success metrics**:
- Recall accuracy (% correct digits)
- Speed of recall (seconds to recite)
- Retention after breaks (accuracy after rest periods)

**Control element**: Learn one number using pure repetition (no spacing) to compare effectiveness.

This should give you concrete data within 3 weeks while proving whether the "breaks" in spaced repetition actually enhance long-term retention compared to massed practice.
