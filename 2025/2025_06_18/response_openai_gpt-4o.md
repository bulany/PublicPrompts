Yes, your idea is both practical and well-suited to a small, controlled experiment. Memorizing phone numbers is an excellent way to test memory techniques and the value of spaced repetition, and your 5-min-per-day, 2‚Äì4-week window is totally reasonable for 3‚Äì4 phone numbers.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Best Techniques for Memorizing Phone Numbers:

Here are a few widely accepted, efficient methods:

### 1. **Chunking** (baseline method)

* Break the number into small chunks (e.g., 0412 345 678).
* Humans are better at remembering 3‚Äì4 digit chunks than 10-digit strings.

### 2. **Mnemonic Peg System** (medium complexity)

* Associate each digit with a phonetic sound (e.g., 0 = s/z, 1 = t/d), then create words from the sounds. This is called the **Major System**.
* 413 ‚Üí "r-a-m" (RAM) or 521 ‚Üí "l-n-d" (Lend)

### 3. **Story or Image Association (Memory Palace)**

* Convert each chunk or digit to a vivid image and place it along a familiar path (your house, walk to the store, etc.).
* Example: 0412 becomes "zero = egg, 4 = sailboat, 1 = candle, 2 = swan" ‚Üí imagine an egg on a sailboat lit by a candle with a swan rowing.

### 4. **Spaced Repetition with Active Recall** (scientifically proven for long-term memory)

* Test yourself at increasing intervals (e.g., Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, etc.).
* Use flashcards or a digital spaced repetition tool (like Anki) if helpful.

## üß™ Your 5-Minute Daily Experiment Plan

This will combine **Chunking + Spaced Repetition + Logging**, with the option to switch or mix in Mnemonics or Story techniques.

### üìÖ Time Span: 2 to 4 weeks

‚úÖ 3‚Äì4 mobile numbers
‚úÖ \~5 minutes/day
‚úÖ Track recall accuracy + perceived difficulty

---

### üìñ Setup (Day 0)

* Choose 3 or 4 real or made-up mobile numbers.
* Assign a name/label to each number (e.g., "Anna", "Work Phone", "Backup SIM").
* Choose one or two memorisation techniques (e.g., Chunking + Story, or Chunking + Major System).
* Write each number in chunked format and decide how you‚Äôll visualize or associate them.
* Create a tiny spreadsheet or notebook with the following columns:

| Day | Number | Recall Attempt | Correct? | Time to Recall | Notes |
| --- | ------ | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |

---

### üìÜ Daily Routine (5 min max)

1. **Recall Phase** (2 min)

   * Try to recall each number from memory **before looking**.
   * Say or write it down. Then check for correctness.
   * Log the result and any errors.

2. **Review Phase** (2‚Äì3 min)

   * If you got it wrong, re-study the number using your chosen technique.
   * Use **spaced repetition rules**:

     * If correct, don't review again today.
     * If wrong, review the number again tomorrow.
     * Push correct numbers to longer intervals (e.g., next review in 3 days, then 6, etc.).

---

### üîÅ Weekly Review (1‚Äì2 mins)

At the end of each week:

* Log how many you got right/wrong across the week.
* Reflect on whether the technique feels easier, harder, or the same.
* Decide whether to keep going or try a new technique for a new number (e.g., swap from Chunking to Major System for one of the numbers).

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Example (if using 4 numbers):

| Week | Task                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Learn 2 numbers using Chunking + Story                              |
| 2    | Learn 2 more with same or different technique                       |
| 3    | Focus on spaced recall only (no new numbers)                        |
| 4    | Final recall tests + reflection on ease, durability, and preference |

## üéØ Success Criteria / Measurable Outcome

At the end, you should be able to answer:

* Which technique was fastest for recall?
* Which one required less effort to retain over time?
* Were spaced intervals easier than daily repetition?
* Could you recall all numbers after 4+ days without review?

* Example numbers to use
* A printable template/log sheet
* Mnemonic or visual stories for each number
* A simplified spaced repetition schedule
