Could you please summarise the story and plot line of the Greek tale of the medusa? 
Does it involve Jason and the argonauts? Is that the only place where the medusa appears?
What is the historical provenance of this story, like what are the main sources it has been passed down through? 
Are there any there any really definitive accounts and how have they been translated or who have they been translated by?
Could the medusa story be some kind of a fable or metaphor that talks about common themes of the human condition or emotional scenarios that humans still face even many years after this story was first told?
I guess I'm asking what is the moral and does it still apply today?
