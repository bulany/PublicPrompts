JS Bach was a prolific and very influential composer. 
I also heard that he had a lot of children.
Could you first summarise his life in some key figures including the number of years lived, the number of children he had and the number of compositions he wrote.
Maybe you could give some kind of a useful average of like during his productive lifetime, how many pieces per week he was writing and how many children per year.
Were all the children he had with the same mother?
Also could you give me a timeline of his life that includes the times when he premiered his most influential pieces of music (I'm particularly interested in the Well Tempered Clavier, The Goldberg Variations, the Tocatta in D minor), and intersperse this with the dates when each of his children born. 
Also maybe you could include any significant dates in music technology history (like I think that the piano was invented during Bach's lifetime right?)
Finally could you imagine what an average day looked like for Bach during the productive years of his life?
I have trouble comprehending how all that he did and achieved is humanely possible, but maybe because this is because I'm comparing his lifestyle with my own. 
Could you make sure you include your knowledge about how daily life was for someone like him, living in the time that he was living and maybe theorise about how he did it all.
Please imagine also that you subscribe to the theory that "talent doesn't exist" ie manifestations of "talent" are exist because we don't see part of the picture or the work that went into acheiving something.
