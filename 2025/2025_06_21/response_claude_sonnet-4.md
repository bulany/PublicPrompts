Let me search for some current information about Bach's life and works to give you the most accurate figures.Let me get more specific information about Bach's major works and their dates.Based on my knowledge and the search results, here's a comprehensive look at Bach's extraordinary life and productivity:

## Key Figures Summary

**Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)**
- **Years lived**: 65 years
- **Children**: 20 children total (7 with first wife Maria Barbara, 13 with second wife Anna Magdalena)
- **Compositions**: Over 1,000 surviving works (though many more were likely composed and lost)
- **Productivity averages during prime years (roughly 1708-1747)**:
  - Approximately **1.3 compositions per week** (assuming 39 productive years)
  - Approximately **0.5 children per year** (spanning 34 years from first to last child)

## Marriage and Family

Bach was married twice – first to Maria Barbara from 1707 to 1720 and then to Anna Magdalena from 1721 to 1750. His first child was born in 1708 when Bach was 23, with his last coming into the world in 1742, when the composer was 57. Sadly, only ten survived through to adulthood.

**Note on the Toccata and Fugue in D minor**: This famous piece was likely composed much earlier in Bach's career (around 1703-1707), though its exact date remains debated among scholars.

**Piano development**: The piano was indeed invented during Bach's lifetime by Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700, but Bach would have primarily used harpsichord, clavichord, and organ.

## An Average Day in Bach's Productive Years (Leipzig period, 1723-1750)

Bach's daily life would have been structured around his official duties and compositional work:

**5:00 AM**: Rise for morning prayers and personal study
**6:00 AM**: Family breakfast and household management
**7:00 AM - 12:00 PM**: Teaching at St. Thomas School, rehearsals with choir boys, administrative duties
**12:00 PM - 2:00 PM**: Midday meal and brief rest
**2:00 PM - 5:00 PM**: Private music lessons (additional income), copying parts, composition
**5:00 PM - 7:00 PM**: Family time, evening meal
**7:00 PM - 10:00 PM**: Intensive composition time, practice, correspondence
**Saturdays**: Preparation for Sunday services, final rehearsals
**Sundays**: Multiple church services, organ playing, conducting

## How Bach Achieved the "Impossible"

Viewing Bach through the "talent doesn't exist" lens reveals several key factors:

**1. Systematic Musical Education from Birth**
Bach was born into Germany's most musical family. From infancy, he was surrounded by music-making relatives, receiving intensive training that modern musicians rarely experience. His musical "talent" was actually decades of accumulated practice starting in early childhood.

**2. Institutional Framework**
Unlike modern composers who must find their own way, Bach worked within established church and court systems that demanded regular musical output. He had to compose weekly cantatas, teach daily, and perform regularly – creating a forcing function for productivity.

**3. Efficient Compositional Methods**
Bach developed systematic approaches to composition, using mathematical principles, established forms, and recycling techniques. He would often rework earlier pieces, adapt instrumental works for voices, and use proven harmonic progressions – maximizing output through intelligent systems.

**4. Different Concept of "Original Composition"**
18th-century musicians regularly borrowed, adapted, and reworked existing material. Bach's "compositions" often involved sophisticated arrangements of folk tunes, adaptation of other composers' works, or clever recombinations of his own material.

**5. Family as Musical Workshop**
The Bachs were always a musical family with a house full of instruments Bach's household functioned as a music workshop where older children helped copy parts, younger ones practiced, and Anna Magdalena served as both performer and copyist. This distributed the workload significantly.

**6. Pre-Industrial Work Patterns**
People in Bach's era worked differently – without modern distractions, artificial lighting limited evening activities to focused work, and multi-tasking was less common. Bach could achieve deep focus for hours daily.

**7. Survival Bias**
We see Bach's surviving works as representing his total output, but many compositions were likely lost. Also, not every weekly cantata was completely original – he adapted, borrowed, and reused material extensively.

The key insight is that Bach's achievement resulted from extraordinary circumstances, systematic methods, family support, institutional demands, and a lifetime of accumulated practice – not mysterious "talent." His productivity becomes comprehensible when we understand the complete system that supported it, rather than viewing him as an isolated genius working alone.
