Another solstice has just passed by and I basically missed it.
I'm wondering if there is a way I can observe the solstice, make note of it and learn what I can from this unique moment in the year without any special equipment.
For example I thought I heard that the person who first measured the size of the earth did so because of properties of the solstice. 
If I live in a normal city is there something I can take note of or something I can measure at this time or is it too hard and you really need special equipment?
