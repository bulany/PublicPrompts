You're thinking of Eratosthenes, who around 240 BCE calculated Earth's circumference using the summer solstice! He noticed that at noon on the solstice in Syene (now Aswan, Egypt), the sun shone straight down a deep well without casting shadows on the walls. Meanwhile, in Alexandria, vertical objects cast shadows at the same time. By measuring the shadow angle in Alexandria and knowing the distance between the cities, he calculated Earth's size with remarkable accuracy.

You can absolutely make meaningful solstice observations from any city without special equipment. Here are some practical approaches:

**Shadow tracking** is the most accessible method. Find a straight vertical object like a fence post, flagpole, or even a broomstick you can hold upright. At solar noon (usually within an hour of clock noon), measure its shadow length and the object's height. The ratio gives you the sun's angle above the horizon. If you have a friend in a different city at roughly the same longitude, you can both take measurements and calculate the difference - this is essentially Eratosthenes' method.

**Daily shadow patterns** reveal the solstice's significance. Place a stick vertically in the ground and mark where its shadow tip falls every hour throughout the day. On the winter solstice, you'll trace out the longest arc of the year. The shadow will point due north at solar noon (in the Northern Hemisphere).

**Window light tracking** works if you have a south-facing window. Mark where sunlight hits your floor or wall at the same time each day. Around the winter solstice, this spot reaches its northernmost position and barely moves for several days - this is why "solstice" means "sun standing still."

**Building shadow observations** are particularly striking in cities. Notice how tall buildings cast their longest shadows of the year during winter solstice. The sun traces its lowest arc across the sky, creating dramatic urban shadow patterns you won't see at other times.

The beauty of solstice observations is that they connect you directly to the astronomical mechanics that govern our planet's relationship with the sun - the same principles Eratosthenes used over 2,000 years ago.
