Of course! It's a wonderful idea to connect with the rhythm of the year by observing the solstice. You've just missed the June solstice, which marks the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. But don't worry, the next one is never too far off, and you can absolutely observe it in a meaningful way without any special equipment, right from your city.

The upcoming solstice, the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, will occur on **Saturday, December 21, 2024**. This is the day with the least amount of daylight. Here are several simple yet profound ways you can take note of this astronomical event.

### Observing the Solstice from the City: Your Guide

The key to observing the solstice is to notice the sun's position in the sky and the shadows it casts. In a city, buildings and streets can act as a giant, free solar observatory.

#### 1. Mark the Sun's Path at its Lowest Point

On the December solstice, the sun will follow its lowest and shortest path across the sky.

* **At Sunrise and Sunset:** Find a window in your home or a spot on your street with a clear view of the horizon. Note where the sun rises and sets in relation to landmarks like buildings, towers, or hills. On the winter solstice, the sun will rise and set at its southernmost points on the horizon. If you were to mark this position and then do the same on the summer solstice (around June 21st), you would see the sunrise and sunset at their northernmost points. The space between these two points marks the annual range of the sun's movement along the horizon.
* **The Midday Sun:** At local noon (the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky for the day), observe how high the sun is. On the December solstice, it will be at its lowest noontime height of the entire year. You can gauge this by its position relative to the top of a familiar building or by simply feeling how low it is in the southern sky.

#### 2. The Telltale Shadow at Noon

This is the most classic and simple measurement you can make, and it directly connects to the historical measurement you mentioned.

* **How to Do It:** Find a sunny spot around noon. You can use any vertical object with a distinct top, such as a lamppost, a flagpole, or even a simple stick you place in a pot of soil on a balcony or in a park.
* **What to Observe:** At local noon, the shadow cast by your object will be the longest it will be all year. The sun is at its lowest point in the sky, so it casts the longest shadows.
* **Make Your Mark:** You can mark the very tip of the shadow with a small stone, a chalk mark, or by taking a picture. If you were to do this every day or even every few weeks, you would see the noon shadow shorten as we approach the summer solstice and lengthen as we approach the winter solstice. This simple observation is a direct measurement of the changing seasons.

### The Solstice and the Size of the Earth: Eratosthenes' Genius

You are absolutely right! The person who first calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy was the Greek mathematician and librarian Eratosthenes, and he did it using observations made on the summer solstice around 240 B.C. Here’s how he did it, and it’s a beautiful example of scientific reasoning:

* **The Observation:** Eratosthenes knew that in the city of Syene (modern-day Aswan, Egypt), on the summer solstice at noon, the sun was directly overhead. This was evident because the sunlight would illuminate the bottom of a deep well, meaning there were no shadows.
* **The Second Measurement:** At the very same time, in his own city of Alexandria, located hundreds of miles to the north, he measured the shadow cast by a tall obelisk. He found that the sun was not directly overhead but was slightly to the south, creating a measurable shadow.
* **The Geometry:** Eratosthenes reasoned that the sun's rays arrive at the Earth in parallel lines. Therefore, the only way a vertical object in Alexandria could cast a shadow while one in Syene did not was if the Earth's surface was curved.
* **The Calculation:** He measured the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and found it to be about 7.2 degrees, which is approximately 1/50th of a full circle (360 degrees). He concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene must therefore be 1/50th of the total circumference of the Earth.

By using the known distance between the two cities, he was able to calculate the Earth's circumference. His result was remarkably close to the value we know today.

### Can You Replicate It?

While you can't perfectly replicate Eratosthenes' experiment without a friend in a city far to your north or south, you can certainly embrace its spirit. When you measure the long shadow of a lamppost on the winter solstice, you are performing the exact same type of measurement that Eratosthenes made in Alexandria. You are measuring the angle of the sun. The difference is that you are observing the sun at its lowest point, while he focused on its highest.

By taking a moment on December 21st to find a clear spot, watch the low arc of the sun, and mark the long shadow at noon, you are not just noting a moment in time. You are participating in a tradition of observation that is thousands of years old and that fundamentally shaped our understanding of the planet we live on. You are, in a very real sense, measuring your place in the cosmos.
