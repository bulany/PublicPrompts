It’s a beautiful instinct to want to connect with the solstice—one of the oldest and most meaningful moments in the human calendar. The good news is: **you don’t need special equipment**. You can still meaningfully observe, mark, and even **measure something interesting**—just like Eratosthenes did over 2,000 years ago.

### 🌞 What Makes the Solstice Special?

At the solstice:

* The **Sun reaches its highest (summer) or lowest (winter) point** in the sky at solar noon.
* It’s the **longest or shortest day** of the year.
* The Sun’s **shadow is at its shortest or longest** of the year at noon.

These are **physical, measurable phenomena**—and you can still observe them for a few days on either side of the solstice.

### 🧭 1. Shadow Stick Experiment (Eratosthenes-Style)

**You can use a stick and a ruler to measure the Sun’s angle**, just as Eratosthenes did when he estimated Earth’s circumference.

#### What to Do:

1. On a sunny day (around the solstice is fine), plant a stick vertically in level ground. A meter stick or broom handle works.
2. At **solar noon** (not clock noon!), measure the **length of the stick’s shadow**.
3. Calculate the **angle of the Sun above the horizon** using trigonometry:

   $$
   \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{height of stick}}{\text{length of shadow}}\right)
   $$

#### What This Tells You:

* The Sun’s angle at solar noon is at its yearly **maximum (summer)** or **minimum (winter)**.
* If you do this at **different times of year**, you’ll see the Sun “tilt” through the sky across the seasons.

### 🌍 2. Eratosthenes’ Method (If You’re Feeling Ambitious)

Eratosthenes measured the Earth’s circumference by:

* Knowing that at noon on the summer solstice, **the Sun was directly overhead** in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt).
* Meanwhile, in Alexandria, a vertical stick cast a measurable shadow.
* By measuring the angle of the shadow and the distance between the cities, he calculated Earth's circumference.

**Could you do this?** Yes, with a friend in another city **due north or south** of you who also measures their solar noon shadow around the same time. You could then:

* Measure the angular difference in Sun elevation.
* Multiply that fraction by the Earth's circumference (or reverse engineer the circumference).

It’s shockingly doable with simple tools and coordination.

### 🗓 3. Marking the Day in Your Personal Calendar

If you're more contemplative:

* **Mark the shadow of a known object (like a lamppost or pole)** on the ground at solar noon. Note the length and direction.
* Repeat this a few times per year (equinox, next solstice). You’ll see the Sun's cycle in the shadows.
* Some people even make **personal “stonehenges”** with markers in their backyard or balcony for solstices and equinoxes.

### 📷 4. Photograph the Sun’s Path (Analemma Style)

You could set up a fixed camera or take a daily photo of the Sun at the same time each day (e.g., noon or 9am). Over time, you’ll trace out the **analemma**, a figure-8 showing the Sun’s yearly path.

### 🔭 No Sun Today?

Even if it’s cloudy or you’re in a dense city:

* Use an app like [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com) or Stellarium to see your local **solar noon** and the Sun's angle.
* Make note of how early or late it gets dark. The shift is subtle but clear.

### 🌱 Why This Matters

Observing the solstice isn’t just a science exercise—it’s a way to:

* Reconnect with the sky and the seasons.
* Ground yourself in the rhythms of the Earth.
* Be part of something humans have been doing for thousands of years.

Even noticing **how the light falls on your wall** or **how plants react to the day’s length** is a way to celebrate.
