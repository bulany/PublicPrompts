When it comes to Greek myths a know a little bit about Perseus, Ulysees and Jason and the Argonauts.
Plus a little bit about Zeus and Haydes... but my knowledge seems fractured, vague and disorganised. 
From a distance the greek myths seem to resemble something like a Marvel or DC comic universe where there is sometimes relationships between the different characters.
Could you give me a top 5 or top 10 of greek myths that everyone should know about (shouldn't be missed) and maybe some kind of way to approach it or organise the stories so they make sense and one can explore further?
Would a chronology be possible? Is the modern say english knowledge of the greek mythological universe coming from a small number of sources?
