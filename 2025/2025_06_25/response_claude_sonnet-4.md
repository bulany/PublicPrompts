You're absolutely right about Greek mythology resembling a comic book universe - that's actually a brilliant comparison! The myths are interconnected, with recurring characters, family dynasties, and story arcs that span generations.

## Essential Greek Myths Everyone Should Know

**The Foundation Stories:**
1. **The Creation Myth & Titanomachy** - How the world began and Zeus overthrew the Titans
2. **Prometheus & Pandora** - Fire theft and humanity's first woman
3. **The Trojan War Cycle** - Including the Iliad, Odyssey, and the events leading up to and following the war

**The Great Heroes:**
4. **Perseus** - Medusa slayer, founder of hero traditions
5. **Theseus** - Minotaur killer, Athens' greatest hero
6. **Heracles (Hercules)** - The twelve labors and ultimate hero
7. **Jason and the Argonauts** - The first great quest narrative

**Divine Drama:**
8. **Persephone & Demeter** - Explains seasons, death, and rebirth
9. **Orpheus & Eurydice** - Love, loss, and the power of art
10. **Oedipus** - Fate, prophecy, and tragic irony

## How to Organize Your Approach

**Start with the cosmic framework:** Think of it like this - first came the Titans (old gods), then the Olympians (new gods led by Zeus) took over. This is your "universe's origin story."

**Then follow the family trees:** The Olympian gods are basically one big dysfunctional family. Zeus is the patriarch with countless affairs, creating heroes and monsters. Tracking these bloodlines helps everything connect.

**Chronological periods work well:**
- **Mythic Past:** Creation, Titans vs Olympians
- **Age of Heroes:** Perseus, Heracles, Theseus (roughly 2-3 generations before Troy)
- **Trojan War Era:** The climactic "event" many stories build toward or reference
- **Returns & Aftermath:** Odyssey and the scattered homecomings

## Your Sources Question

You're absolutely right - our English knowledge comes from surprisingly few ancient sources! The main ones are:

**Homer** (8th century BCE) - *Iliad* and *Odyssey* - these are like the "Bible" of Greek myth
**Hesiod** - *Theogony* (creation myths) and *Works and Days*
**The Tragedians** - Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides (5th century BCE)
**Apollodorus** - *Library* (much later, but comprehensive)
**Ovid** - *Metamorphoses* (Roman, but crucial for many versions we know)

Think of Homer as Stan Lee - he didn't create everything, but he shaped how we understand the entire universe. Many "Greek" myths we know actually come through Roman writers like Ovid.

The beauty is that you already know some of the biggest players (Perseus, Odysseus, Jason). From here, you could dive deeper into the Trojan War cycle since it connects to everything, or explore the family relationships between heroes - many are related or connected to each other in surprising ways.
