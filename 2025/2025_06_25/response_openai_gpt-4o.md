You're spot on in comparing Greek mythology to something like the Marvel or DC universe—interconnected characters, recurring themes, epic adventures, betrayals, and even cosmic origins. The myths form a vast web with gods, heroes, and mortals often crossing paths. While the stories aren't strictly chronological, many can be organized loosely into cycles or generations that help bring order to the chaos.

## ✅ Quick Overview: How to Approach Greek Mythology

### 📚 1. **Understand the Sources**

Most of what we know comes from a handful of ancient authors:

* **Homer** – *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*: foundation of the Trojan War mythos.
* **Hesiod** – *Theogony*: a creation story of gods and the cosmos.
* **Apollodorus** – *Bibliotheca (Library)*: a more systematic compilation of myths.
* **Euripides, Aeschylus, Sophocles** – playwrights who dramatized myths for the stage.
* **Ovid** (Roman, but vital) – *Metamorphoses*: poetic retelling of Greek myths.

Many English-language compilations (like Edith Hamilton’s *Mythology* or Robert Graves’ works) are based on these ancient sources.
