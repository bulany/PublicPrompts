I have a vague memory of a teacher in high school telling us about "bissell est bissell" and that it translates to "order are orders" and this was not a defence that stood up in the courts in the trials of world war 2 war criminals.
Is this a true story? Is it well documented somewhere?
Why would that teacher be telling us that?
Is the moral that there is always some sense of personal responsibility?
Does this relate at all to "the banality of evil"?
Can you explain what this phrase means and where it comes from?
Can you think of any examples of this kind of "banal evilness" that exist in the world at present (ie that are going on right now and that we might be participating in)?
