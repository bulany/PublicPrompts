Your memory is quite accurate! Your teacher was referring to "Befehl ist Befehl" (German for "an order is an order"), which became known as the "superior orders" defense or "Nuremberg defense" used by Nazi war criminals during the post-WWII trials.

This defense was indeed rejected by the courts. The Nuremberg trials established the precedent that "using superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and their liability to be punished in court". The legal principle established was that individuals remain morally and legally responsible for their actions, even when ordered by superiors.

Your teacher was likely teaching this as a crucial lesson about personal responsibility and moral agency. The message is exactly as you understood: there is always some level of personal responsibility, and "just following orders" is not an acceptable excuse for participating in atrocities or illegal acts.

This absolutely relates to Hannah Arendt's concept of "the banality of evil." Arendt coined this phrase after observing Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in 1961. She found that Eichmann was "not inherently evil, but merely shallow and clueless, a 'joiner'" who "drifted into the Nazi Party, in search of purpose". The "banality of evil" refers to how "evil does not have the Satan-like, villainous appearance we might typically associate it with". Instead, Eichmann "displayed neither guilt for his actions nor hatred for those trying him, claiming he bore no responsibility because he was simply 'doing his job'".

Arendt's key insight was that Eichmann's "inability to speak was closely connected with an inability to think, namely, to think from the standpoint of somebody else". The most frightening thing wasn't that he was a monster, but that he was thoughtless—he failed to think critically about what he was doing.

As for contemporary examples of "banal evil," this is where we might examine systems and structures around us where people participate in harmful practices through thoughtlessness, bureaucratic detachment, or simply "following procedures." Some scholars point to various institutional failures—whether in healthcare systems that deny care through bureaucratic processes, economic systems that perpetuate inequality through seemingly neutral policies, environmental destruction through corporate compliance with inadequate regulations, or surveillance systems that violate privacy through routine data collection.

The key insight from both "Befehl ist Befehl" and "the banality of evil" is that ordinary people can become complicit in terrible things not through malicious intent, but through thoughtlessness, conformity, and the abdication of personal moral responsibility. Your teacher was emphasizing that we all have a duty to think critically about our actions and their consequences, regardless of what authorities tell us to do.
