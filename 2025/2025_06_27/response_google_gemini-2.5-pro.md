### The Myth of "Bissell est Bissell" and the Enduring Reality of "The Banality of Evil"

A high school teacher's memorable, albeit slightly misremembered, lesson about the defense of "order are orders" in the World War II war crime trials touches upon a cornerstone of modern international law and a profound philosophical concept. While the phrase your teacher likely intended was the German "Befehl ist Befehl," the underlying story and its moral implications are indeed true, well-documented, and continue to resonate in contemporary society through the concept of "the banality of evil."

#### The Rejection of "Orders are Orders"

Your memory of "bissell est bissell" is likely a phonetic recollection of the German phrase **"Befehl ist Befehl,"** which translates to **"an order is an order."** This phrase encapsulates the "superior orders" or "Nuremberg defense," a legal argument put forth by numerous Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials and subsequent war crime tribunals following World War II. The defendants claimed they were not personally responsible for their horrific actions because they were merely following the orders of their superiors.

However, the Allied-led International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg decisively rejected this defense. The tribunal's charter, specifically Article 8, stated: **"The fact that the Defendant acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility, but may be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines that justice so requires."** This principle established a revolutionary precedent in international law: individuals are personally responsible for their actions, even when acting under orders, especially if those orders are manifestly illegal. The moral and legal-philosophical underpinning of this is that there is a higher duty to fundamental principles of humanity that can override military or state-sanctioned orders.

Your teacher was telling this story to impart a crucial lesson about **personal responsibility**. The rejection of the "Befehl ist Befehl" defense serves as a powerful historical example that blind obedience is not a valid excuse for committing atrocities. It underscores the idea that every individual possesses moral agency and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, and is expected to exercise that judgment.

#### The Banality of Evil: From Eichmann's Trial to Today

This concept of individual responsibility in the face of authority is deeply intertwined with what political theorist Hannah Arendt termed **"the banality of evil."** Arendt coined this phrase in her 1963 book, *Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil*, which she wrote after observing the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the Holocaust.

Arendt expected to see a monstrous, hate-filled ideologue. Instead, she was struck by how ordinary and mediocre Eichmann appeared. He presented himself not as a fanatic, but as a diligent bureaucrat, a "cog in the machine" who was simply "doing his job." His evil, she argued, was "banal" not because it was commonplace, but because it was born of a profound **thoughtlessness**. Eichmann, in her analysis, was not a sadist or a sociopath, but a man who, through a combination of careerism, conformity, and an inability to think from the perspective of others, became a key figure in the mass murder of millions. He was not motivated by a deep-seated hatred, but by a desire to be an efficient administrator and to please his superiors.

"The banality of evil," therefore, describes the phenomenon of ordinary people committing horrendous acts not out of malice or ideological fervor, but through a kind of moral and intellectual laziness. It is the evil of the unthinking conformist, the person who accepts the given premises of a system without critical reflection on their real-world consequences.

#### Contemporary Manifestations of "Banal Evilness"

The concept of the "banality of evil" remains alarmingly relevant today, often in ways that we ourselves might be participating in, consciously or not. Here are a few examples of this "banal evilness" in the modern world:

* **The Spread of Misinformation on Social Media:** The uncritical sharing of articles, memes, and videos without verifying their authenticity or considering their potential to incite hatred, division, or violence is a modern form of thoughtlessness. The algorithms of social media platforms often reward sensational and emotionally charged content, and individuals who participate in its dissemination without critical engagement can contribute to real-world harm, from political polarization to violence against minority groups. The act of sharing may seem trivial, but its cumulative effect can be devastating.

* **The Fast Fashion Industry:** The demand for cheap, trendy clothing has created a global industry notorious for its exploitation of labor and its devastating environmental impact. While consumers may not have malicious intent, their participation in this system—driven by a desire for novelty and low prices—perpetuates a cycle of poverty wages, unsafe working conditions for garment workers (predominantly women and children in developing countries), and massive pollution. The evil here is banal in its detachment; the consumer rarely confronts the human and environmental cost of their cheap t-shirt.

* **Societal Indifference to Climate Change:** Despite overwhelming scientific consensus on the causes and catastrophic consequences of climate change, collective action remains sluggish. This inertia is a form of "banal evil." For many, the problem feels too vast, the individual contribution too small, and the necessary lifestyle changes too inconvenient. The thoughtless continuation of unsustainable consumption patterns, the prioritization of short-term economic gain over long-term planetary health, and the political apathy that allows for inadequate policy responses all contribute to a crisis that will cause immense suffering, particularly for the world's most vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, your teacher's lesson, though based on a slightly misremembered phrase, pointed to a profound and enduring truth. The rejection of the "orders are orders" defense at Nuremberg and Hannah Arendt's subsequent analysis of "the banality of evil" compel us to recognize our own capacity for thoughtlessness and our individual responsibility to critically examine the systems in which we participate. It is a call to move beyond mere obedience and to cultivate a thoughtful and empathetic engagement with the world, lest we too become cogs in a machine with devastating consequences.
