Your memory touches on several powerful and interconnected themes: **personal responsibility**, **obedience to authority**, **the moral limits of following orders**, and **the banality of evil**â€”all of which emerged from reflections on the atrocities committed during the Second World War and their aftermath. Let's break it down.

### ðŸ”¹ **"Bissel ist bissel" / "Orders are orders"**

You're probably remembering the **German phrase "Befehl ist Befehl"**, which translates to **"an order is an order."** This phrase became infamous during and after **the Nuremberg Trials** (1945â€“1946), where Nazi officials and military personnel were tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

Many defendants claimed they were just following ordersâ€”that they had **no choice** but to obey their superiors. However, this **"superior orders" defense was rejected** as insufficient. The tribunal held that **individuals have a duty to refuse unlawful orders**, especially when those orders involve atrocities like genocide or torture.

#### ðŸ“š Documentation:

* The **Nuremberg Principles**, especially Principle IV, explicitly state:

  > *"The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility... provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him."*
* This is now a **cornerstone of international law**, including in modern frameworks like the **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court**.

So yes, this is a **well-documented historical reality**.

### ðŸ”¹ Why would a teacher mention this?

Your teacher likely brought this up to prompt **ethical reflection**â€”especially about the **limits of obedience**, the **responsibility of individuals within systems**, and the **importance of moral courage**. These are questions that remain deeply relevant for young people becoming adults in complex societies.

### ðŸ”¹ Is the moral that there is always some sense of personal responsibility?

**Yes.** One of the main lessons from the Nuremberg Trials and similar historical reckonings is that **"I was just doing my job" is not an adequate excuse** when serious moral or legal violations are involved. There is a **baseline human responsibility** to **refuse participation in evil**, even when pressured by authority or systems.

### ðŸ”¹ The Banality of Evil â€“ What does this mean?

This phrase comes from **Hannah Arendt**, a German-Jewish philosopher who reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann (a key architect of the Holocaust) in her 1963 book *"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil."*

Arendt observed that Eichmann was not a monster in the traditional senseâ€”he was disturbingly **ordinary**, a **bureaucrat** who organized logistics for mass murder not out of hatred, but out of **careerism, obedience, and a refusal to think critically** about the consequences of his actions.

> **The "banality" of evil** means that **horrific acts can be committed by seemingly normal people**, not because they are sadistic, but because they are **unquestioning**, **obedient**, or **morally disengaged**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Are there examples of this kind of "banal evilness" in the world today?

Unfortunately, **yes**. Many large-scale harms today involve **systems** where people contribute to suffering **without directly intending to**, often because their **individual role feels small or abstract**.

#### Some examples that might relate:

* **Climate change**: People work for corporations that knowingly contribute to ecological destruction, sometimes justifying it as "just business" or "my job."
* **Factory farming**: Millions support an industry that causes immense suffering to animals through everyday purchases.
* **Sweatshop labor**: Workers in poor countries face abuse and exploitation to produce cheap goods, yet consumers and corporate employees often look away.
* **Digital surveillance and data exploitation**: Many tech workers help build systems that erode privacy or enable authoritarian regimes, often without considering long-term ethical consequences.

These aren't equivalent to Nazi crimes, but they illustrate **how ordinary roles can accumulate into collective harm**â€”especially when **no one questions the system**.

### ðŸ”¸ Final Thought

The takeaway from your teacher's lessonâ€”and from Arendt, Nuremberg, and modern ethicsâ€”is this:

> **Moral responsibility doesnâ€™t disappear just because you're following orders.**
>
> Evil doesnâ€™t always come from monstersâ€”it can come from **indifference, conformity, and thoughtlessness.**

Itâ€™s a call to remain **ethically awake**, to **question systems**, and to **act with conscience** even when it's inconvenient.
