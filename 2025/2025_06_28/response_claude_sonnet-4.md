Karpathos is a fascinating Greek island located in the Dodecanese chain between Crete and Rhodes. It's the second-largest island in the Dodecanese and has a rugged, mountainous terrain with dramatic coastlines and beautiful beaches.

The island has a rich cultural heritage, particularly known for preserving traditional Greek customs, folk music, and dress. The village of Olympos in the northern part of the island is especially famous for maintaining centuries-old traditions, with locals still wearing traditional costumes and speaking a dialect that preserves ancient Greek elements.

Regarding Greek mythology, Karpathos doesn't feature prominently in the major mythological narratives like Crete does with the Minotaur. However, the island does have some mythological connections:

- It was associated with the Titans in some ancient sources
- The island was sometimes linked to the sea god Poseidon
- Like many Greek islands, it had connections to various minor myths and local legends, though these aren't as well-preserved or famous as the major mythological cycles

The island's ancient name was sometimes given as Karpathos or Krapathos, and it was mentioned by ancient writers, but it wasn't a major setting for the famous mythological stories that capture popular imagination today.

As for being a "blue zone," Karpathos is not officially recognized as one of the five established blue zones (which include places like Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria in Greece). However, like many Greek islands, it does have a traditional Mediterranean lifestyle with a diet rich in olive oil, fresh vegetables, and seafood, along with strong family and community bonds, which are factors associated with longevity. The nearby island of Ikaria is actually one of the recognized blue zones.
