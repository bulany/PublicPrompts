Let's say the true nature of evil is actually quite banal (as Hanna Arendt observed)... and results from a kind of moral laziness, thoughtlessness, conformism and the desire to please one's "superiors". We could observe that modern examples of banal evil in our societies are things like our unwitting contribution to climate change, the fast fashion industry or mindlessly sharing potential harmful social media posts on social media... do you think that there could be an opposite form of "banal good" that we can somehow participate in just a small way everyday that may potentially add up. If such an antidote to "banal evil" exists can you give some examples of it in action in contemporary society?
