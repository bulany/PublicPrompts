I would like to develop an instinct and technique for easily making bubble mixture and bubbles that kids can play with. I saw a handheld electric bubble machine that seem to churn out endless bubbles - they weren't so big, but bubbles don't need to be big to amuse kids. And I'm wondering how I can do this kind of thing with just things I have around the house. I looked into one bubble mixture recipe on the internet which was fairly basic - just dish soap and something called "j lube". I like the simplicity of this recipe but it mentioned that its best to leave the mixture for 24 hours (why?)... anyway I'll probably be making these bubbles in France so ideally it would be good to only use ingredients that I can find easily in a French supermarket, and I'm never really organised so it would be great to have a simple recipe that works good for many small bubbles that you don't have to necessarily wait 24 hours. Can you help me with all this and give me a step by step plan to follow?
