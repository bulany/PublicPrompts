I'll help you create a simple bubble-making setup that works great for kids and uses ingredients easily found in French supermarkets!

## Why the 24-hour wait?
The waiting period allows soap molecules to fully hydrate and align, creating stronger, more stable bubbles. However, you can definitely make good bubbles immediately - they'll just be slightly less durable.

## Simple French Supermarket Recipe

**Basic ingredients you'll find anywhere in France:**
- Liquide vaisselle (dish soap) - brands like Paic or Fairy work well
- Glyc√©rine (available at pharmacies or some supermarkets in the health section)
- Water (preferably filtered or bottled if your tap water is very hard)

**Recipe:**
- 1 cup water
- 2-3 tablespoons dish soap
- 1 tablespoon glycerin (this replaces the "J-Lube" and helps bubbles last longer)

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Mix gently** - Combine ingredients in a bowl, stirring slowly to avoid creating foam
2. **Test immediately** - Try making bubbles right away to see how they perform
3. **Adjust as needed** - Add more soap for easier bubble formation, more glycerin for stronger bubbles
4. **Make bubble wands** - Bend wire coat hangers, use straws, or even make holes in plastic bottle caps

## Quick Bubble-Making Tools
- **Multi-bubble wand**: Tape several straws together
- **Giant bubble wand**: String tied between two sticks
- **Continuous bubbles**: Dip a slotted spoon and wave it gently

The key is having enough soapy mixture and gentle, steady motion. Kids love the quantity more than perfection, so don't worry if they're not competition-grade bubbles!
