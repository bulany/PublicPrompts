Do you know the following pslam?
```
L'Eternal est mon berger,
Je ne manquerai de rien...
Il m'a établi en de verts pâturages.
```
Where does this pslam come from and what is its english version?
Where do pslams come from in general and how do they fit into "the bible" etc?
Do we know who wrote this particular psalm and why they wrote it? 
Where they at a particular point in their life? 
What were the circumstances?
Do you have an opinion on its meaning?
The last line, I'm less sure of its meaning... the use of the work "Il" seems to strongly indicate "god" and a male god at that... but is there a more universal meaning?
Finally do you see any utility in learning this pslam off by heart and how would you suggest I go about that efficiently?
