This is Psalm 23 in French, one of the most well-known psalms in the Bible. The English version begins:

"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures..."

**Origins and Biblical Context**

Psalms are a collection of 150 religious songs, prayers, and poems found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and Christian Old Testament. They form their own book and served various purposes - worship, personal devotion, communal ceremonies, and expressing the full range of human spiritual experience from praise to lament.

**Authorship of Psalm 23**

This psalm is traditionally attributed to King David, though modern biblical scholarship questions many traditional attributions. The superscription reads "A Psalm of David." If David did write it, it would likely draw from his background as a shepherd before becoming king - the shepherd imagery would be deeply personal. However, we don't have definitive historical evidence about the specific circumstances of its composition.

**Meaning and Interpretation**

The psalm uses the metaphor of God as a shepherd caring for his flock. It progresses from pastoral imagery (green pastures, still waters) to more challenging terrain (valley of the shadow of death) to a feast setting, suggesting God's care through all life's circumstances.

**Regarding the Masculine Language**

You're right to notice the masculine pronouns. In Hebrew, the word for God (Elohim) and the divine name (YHWH) are grammatically masculine, which carries through to translations. Many modern readers interpret this as reflecting ancient linguistic conventions rather than limiting God's nature to masculine qualities. Some contemporary translations use gender-neutral language, though this remains debated.

**Learning It by Heart**

There's value in memorizing meaningful texts - it creates a portable source of comfort and reflection. For efficient memorization:
- Break it into natural phrases
- Use the rhythm and poetic structure 
- Practice daily recitation
- Write it out repeatedly
- Connect the imagery to mental pictures

The shepherd metaphor has resonated across cultures and millennia because it captures something universal about seeking guidance, protection, and provision in life's journey.
