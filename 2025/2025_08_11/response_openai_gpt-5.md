Alright — let’s unpack your questions carefully and go layer by layer.

## 1. **Where does this psalm come from?**

Your excerpt is from **Psalm 23**, one of the most famous passages in the Bible.
Your French text:

> L’Éternel est mon berger,
> Je ne manquerai de rien…
> Il m’a établi en de verts pâturages.

…is an adaptation of the start of **Psaume 23:1-2** in the *Louis Segond* French translation of the Bible (though your version seems paraphrased).
In English (King James Version, 1611):

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

## 2. **Where do psalms come from, and how do they fit into the Bible?**

* The **Psalms** are a collection of **150 ancient Hebrew poems, songs, and prayers**.
* They form a single book called *Tehillim* in Hebrew (“Praises”), which is part of the **Ketuvim** (“Writings”) section of the Hebrew Bible.
* In Christian Bibles, Psalms appear in the Old Testament, often right in the middle.
* They were written over many centuries — not one author, but a compilation.

## 3. **Who wrote Psalm 23, and under what circumstances?**

* **Tradition** attributes Psalm 23 to **King David** (c. 1000 BCE), the shepherd-turned-warrior who became king of Israel.
* We can’t prove authorship definitively, but ancient tradition strongly associates it with him.
* **Life context:** If David did write it, it may have been during a time of uncertainty or danger — possibly while he was being hunted by Saul, or reflecting later in life on God’s guidance.
* The shepherd imagery is doubly meaningful because David was literally a shepherd in his youth.

## 4. **Opinion on its meaning**

Psalm 23 is often read as a declaration of **trust**:

> "I am guided, cared for, and protected — even in uncertainty — so I have no lack."

The green pastures imagery is about **rest, abundance, and renewal** rather than just literal grass. It’s about the feeling of being led somewhere safe and sustaining.

## 5. **The last line — “Il m’a établi en de verts pâturages”**

* **Literal meaning:** “He has placed me in green pastures.”
* **Symbolic meaning:** being given a place of peace, sustenance, and growth.
* **About “Il” being male:** In Hebrew, God’s name (YHWH) is grammatically masculine, but this is a limitation of the language, not a biological description.
* You could read “Il” as “the guiding presence” or “the source of life,” without attaching literal gender — in that sense, the meaning can be universal.

## 6. **Utility in learning this psalm by heart**

Yes, memorizing it can be useful — not just spiritually, but also as a **mental anchor**. People often recite it in stressful moments; it can provide emotional steadiness.

**Efficient memorization tips:**

1. **Chunk it** — break it into 2–3 verse sections.
2. **Repeat aloud** — rhythm and sound help memory.
3. **Visualize** — picture a shepherd, green pastures, still waters.
4. **Link each line** — see the psalm as a journey from rest → guidance → protection → home.
5. **Review daily** — 1 minute in the morning and at night.
6. **Say it in your own words** — this deepens understanding and recall.

If you want, I can give you a **bilingual side-by-side version** (French + English) of Psalm 23 formatted specifically for memorization so you can learn it almost like a poem.
That way you’ll get both the original sense and the poetic flow.

Do you want me to prepare that?
