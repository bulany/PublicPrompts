Your approach is fascinating and shows real dedication! The fact that you committed to 6 months of daily practice demonstrates serious commitment to learning. Let me share some thoughts on why your experience might have differed from Jahari's and how you could optimize your next attempt.

**Why the results might have differed:**

Jahari had several advantages that likely contributed to his success:
- **Musical foundation**: His percussion background gave him rhythm, timing, and musical pattern recognition
- **Age factor**: At 15, his brain was still in peak neuroplasticity for motor skill acquisition
- **Personal connection**: The song was already a favorite, and seeing someone who looked like him created strong emotional engagement
- **Gaming mindset**: His "buttons not keys" approach removed intimidation and leveraged existing motor skills

**Your software idea is brilliant** and addresses real learning challenges. A video annotation app that lets you:
- Mark timestamps with finger positions
- Create loops of small sections
- Build a personal notation system
- Generate MIDI for verification
- Practice anywhere on your phone

This could be incredibly effective because it breaks down the overwhelming task into manageable, portable chunks.

**Suggestions for your approach:**

Instead of trying to learn the entire 5-minute piece linearly, consider:
- Start with just the first 15-30 seconds and master that completely
- Focus on hand positions and movements, not just which notes
- Use your percussion background - tap out rhythms on any surface first
- Create "muscle memory checkpoints" - short segments you can play without thinking

**Alternative learning methods to complement the video:**
- Try playing along with slowed-down versions (YouTube's playback speed feature)
- Record yourself playing sections and compare to the original
- Focus on the "feel" of chord progressions, not just individual notes

Your software concept could genuinely help many people learn this way. The key insight about making it "bus stop portable" recognizes that consistent, frequent engagement often beats long, infrequent practice sessions.
