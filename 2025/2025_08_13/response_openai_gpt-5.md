I think your instinct here is exactly right — the thing that separated Jahari’s 6-month process from yours may not have been “mystical talent,” but the *way* he chunked, tested, and reinforced the material.
You’ve already spotted that a crochet-like workflow — small, portable, buildable stitches — is the kind of practice method that can actually get you to musical fluency.

Let me unpack this in a way that gives you a practical path forward.

---

## 1. Why Jahari’s approach worked so well

From his own description, it sounds like:

* **He chunked the piece unconsciously** — memorising small “button sequences” until they felt automatic.
* **He repeated these sequences until boredom** — which means his brain and fingers had deep, slow, correct repetitions.
* **He gamified it** — turning keys into “buttons” meant his focus was on hitting the right targets in the right order, not on the abstract musical notation.
* **He was laser-focused** — same song, same video, same “game board” for months.

You *can* emulate this — but the “game” you’re building has to give you instant, precise feedback and let you keep score on your own progress.

## 2. Why your first attempt stalled

From what you described, I’d guess:

* **5 minutes/day** might be too little to lock in motor memory unless it’s hyper-targeted.
* Without a *micro-goal system*, each day probably felt like “trying again” rather than “beating level 12.”
* No reliable **check for accuracy** — you could play a section “close enough” without being sure it was truly correct.
* Video rewinding and visual guessing is *mentally heavy* without a way to annotate or confirm.

So the problem wasn’t *watching for 6 months*, it was *how the material was broken down and rehearsed*.

## 3. What would make your second attempt effective

### A. Break it into “game levels”

* Chop the performance into **2–6 second clips** — each one should be playable *without stopping* and have a clear start/stop.
* Your “Level 1” is just the first clip. You master it, then stack “Level 2,” and so on.
* Levels can overlap slightly so transitions are smooth.

### B. Build an *annotatable playback tool*

* A mobile app or web app that:

  * Plays the video in slow motion (50%, 75%).
  * Lets you loop exact timestamps.
  * Lets you tag events (“LH 3rd finger on A3”).
  * Optionally, stores *textual notation* of the sequence that you can review away from the piano.

> If you want this, it’s *totally feasible* to build with a basic JavaScript/React web app that can run on your phone. The data can just be JSON: `{ time: 12.342, hand: 'L', finger: 3, note: 'A3' }`.

### C. Practice without the piano

This is a huge brain-hack:
If you can *mentally* rehearse the sequence of “button presses” away from the instrument, you double your exposure time.

* You could print a little *flat paper keyboard* or use a mobile mock keyboard.
* Your invented notation could be shorthand for finger→note sequences.
* Mentally “play” while listening to the clip — you’ll find your hands move more confidently later.

### D. “Crochet” structure for practice

* Keep your annotation tool and clip loops on your phone.
* At the bus stop: review a loop, run through the finger sequence mentally, listen for timing.
* At home: immediately try the same loop on the piano.
* Each day = finish one stitch (clip) or polish yesterday’s.

## 4. About your “custom notation” idea

That’s actually brilliant and could make the whole process more portable.
You don’t need full formal notation — you just need:

```
[12.342] L3 A3
[12.540] R1 C4
...
```

Where:

* `L` / `R` = Left or Right hand
* Number = finger (1 = thumb)
* Note = pitch (A3, C4, etc.)
* Brackets = time in seconds from video start

You can later:

* **Export to MIDI** (to check accuracy against the original performance)
* **Sort & play back** with a software synth
* Even **visualise** with a falling-notes interface

## 5. How to keep motivation high

* Treat each clip as a *miniature achievement*, like a level in a game.
* Keep a visible “map” of the song, colouring in mastered sections.
* Record yourself playing a clip correctly before moving on — reviewing old clips shows progress.

If you want, I can sketch you a **basic design for a bus-stop-friendly annotation + playback app** that runs in your phone’s browser, stores your annotations offline, and can later export them to MIDI. That way you’d have the “crochet project” feel you’re imagining but in musical form.

Would you like me to outline that next?
