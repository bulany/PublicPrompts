### The Curious Case of the Silent 'P' in "Psalm": A Tale of Ancient Roots and Linguistic Journeys

The English word "psalm" and its French counterpart "psaume" share a fascinating and intertwined history that stretches back to ancient Greece, explaining their unusual spelling and the silent 'p' that perplexes many. While it might seem that the word was simply borrowed from French into English, the story is more complex, involving early Germanic adoption and later scholarly "corrections."

The journey of "psalm" begins with the Ancient Greek word **ψαλμός (psalmós)**, which literally meant "a plucking of strings," particularly those of a harp. Over time, it came to signify the song that accompanied this harp music. This Greek term was adopted into Latin as **psalmus**, which then spread throughout Europe with the influence of the Church.

The reason for the silent 'p' in the English "psalm" is a result of a later, scholarly decision. The word entered Old English as **"psealm"** or **"sealm"** before the Norman Conquest of 1066, likely borrowed directly from the Latin used in the church. At that time, the initial "ps" sound was likely simplified to just an "s" sound in common speech.

Following the Norman Conquest, the Old French word **"psalme"** (which later became "psaume") reinforced the presence of the word in English. However, during the Renaissance, there was a trend among scholars to "correct" the spelling of words to reflect their classical origins. In the case of "psalm," the 'p' was reinserted into the spelling to align it with the Latin *psalmus* and the Greek *psalmós*. Despite this spelling change, the pronunciation without the 'p' sound had already been firmly established in everyday English and thus remained silent. Interestingly, while many other European languages also adopted the "ps-" spelling, English is one of the few that does not pronounce the initial 'p'.

The French word **"psaume"** followed a similar path from Latin. It appeared in Old French as "salme" or "psalme." Like in English, the initial 'p' was silent for a long period. However, in modern French, the trend of pronouncing words as they are spelled has led to the 'p' in "psaume" being voiced, though softly.

So, to answer the user's final question, it's not entirely accurate to say that "psalm" was first integrated into French and then found its way into English. The word, in an earlier form, existed in Old English prior to the major influence of French. However, the Old French "psalme" certainly reinforced and influenced the word's usage and spelling in Middle English. Both the English and French words are essentially siblings, descending from the same Latin ancestor, with their modern forms shaped by their unique linguistic histories and the scholarly trend of looking back to classical roots.
