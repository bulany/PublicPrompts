The word *psalm* is indeed a bit of an oddball in both English and French, and its history explains the silent **p** and the resemblance to “song.”

Here’s the short version first:

* It didn’t start in French.
* English and French both got it from **Latin** (*psalmus*), which got it from **Greek** (*psalmos*).
* The **p** was always there in the Greek spelling, but in both Latin and later French, it became silent.

### The deeper history

**Greek origin**:

* The Greek word is **ψαλμός** (*psalmos*), from the verb **ψάλλειν** (*psallein*) meaning “to pluck (strings of an instrument)” — like a harp or lyre.
* So originally, a *psalmos* was *a song accompanied by stringed instruments*, not just any song. This is why it has a musical feel to it.
* The **ps** in Greek is a normal consonant cluster (both letters pronounced), but in Latin and later languages it became awkward.

**Latin borrowing**:

* The Romans borrowed it as **psalmus**. Latin speakers already tended to drop the /p/ in “ps” clusters when speaking (though they kept it in spelling).
* The meaning shifted toward *a sacred song* — specifically those in the Hebrew Bible.

**Old French**:

* Latin *psalmus* became Old French *psaume*, keeping the spelling but not the /p/ sound.
* French kept the silent p in writing because medieval scribes were sticklers for Latin-based spellings, especially for church words.

**English borrowing**:

* English borrowed the word twice:

  1. **From Old English** (*sealm*), a much earlier borrowing from Latin that had lost the **p** entirely in spelling and sound.
  2. Later, from Old French *psaume*, reintroducing the Latin-like **p** into the spelling, but still not pronouncing it.

That’s why modern English has both:

* The old form in compounds like *salter* (meaning a book of psalms).
* The fancy church form *psalm* with the silent p.

**Why it feels weird in French too**:
Because French usually doesn’t start words with “ps–”, except for learned borrowings from Greek via Latin (*psychologie*, *psaume*, *psoriasis*). They’re all “bookish” imports, not native French developments.

If you’re wondering:
It’s not from the same root as “song” — but the link is real: *psalm* literally meant “plucked song.” The “p” is silent today because Latin and French pronunciation habits won out, not because it was invented silently in French and then passed to English.

If you like, I can also map out a **timeline showing how the pronunciation and spelling changed step-by-step** from Greek to English and French — it’s actually quite a satisfying little language evolution.
