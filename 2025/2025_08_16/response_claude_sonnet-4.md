The English word "song" and French "chanson" do indeed come from different etymological roots, which explains why they look so different despite meaning the same thing.

"Song" comes from Old English "sang," which is related to the verb "singan" (to sing). This traces back to Proto-Germanic *sangwaz and ultimately to the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂enǵʰ-, meaning "to sing" or "to sound." You can see related words in other Germanic languages: German "Gesang," Dutch "zang," and Old Norse "söngr."

"Chanson," on the other hand, comes from Latin "cantio" (meaning "a singing" or "song"), which derives from the verb "canere" (to sing). This Latin root also gave us English words like "chant," "cantata," and "incantation." The French word evolved through Vulgar Latin *cantione(m) into Old French "chanson."

So while both words ultimately trace back to Proto-Indo-European roots related to singing, they took completely different paths through the Germanic and Romance language families respectively. This is a perfect example of how English, despite being fundamentally Germanic, exists alongside a parallel Romance vocabulary due to the Norman Conquest and centuries of French influence - yet in this case, the Germanic word "song" remained dominant over any Romance alternative.

It's interesting that English kept its Germanic word for such a basic concept, while adopting Romance vocabulary for many other areas of life.
