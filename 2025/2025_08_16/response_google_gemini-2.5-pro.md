Yes, the English word 'song' and the French word 'chanson' are indeed from different roots, even though their meanings are very similar. Their distinct origins can be traced back to different Proto-Indo-European roots.

### The Germanic Root of 'Song'

The word **'song'** has its origins in the Germanic family of languages. Its etymological journey is as follows:

* **Old English:** *sang*, which meant "voice, vocal music, a song, or the art of singing."
* **Proto-Germanic:** This Old English word came from **\*sangwaz**.
* **Proto-Indo-European:** The Germanic term is believed to derive from the root **\*sengʷh-**, which meant "to sing" or "to chant."

This same Germanic root is the ancestor of the word for 'song' in many other Germanic languages, such as *Gesang* in German, *zang* in Dutch, and *sång* in Swedish.

### The Latin Root of 'Chanson'

In contrast, the word **'chanson'** is of Latin origin and entered the French language through the following path:

* **Old French:** *chançon*, which meant "a song" or "epic poem."
* **Latin:** This Old French word evolved from the Latin word **cantio** (or its accusative form *cantionem*), which meant "a song" or "singing."
* **Proto-Indo-European:** The Latin term is derived from the verb *canere*, meaning "to sing," which in turn comes from the root **\*kan-**, also meaning "to sing."

This Latin root *kan-* is the source of many other English words related to singing and sound, often borrowed from French or Latin, such as 'chant,' 'cantata,' 'incantation,' and 'accent.'

Therefore, while both 'song' and 'chanson' ultimately trace back to Proto-Indo-European roots that mean "to sing," they come from two distinct and unrelated roots: **\*sengʷh-** for the Germanic line that produced 'song' and **\*kan-** for the Latin line that gave us 'chanson.' This is a fascinating example of how different linguistic streams can develop words with very similar meanings from separate ancient sources.
