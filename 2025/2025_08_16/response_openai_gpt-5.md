Great question! The English **“song”** and the French **“chanson”** do look and sound very different, and that’s because, although they ultimately come from the *same* ancient root, they traveled down different linguistic paths. Let’s unpack it:

---

### English **song**

* From Old English **sang** / **song** = "a song, singing, poetry, chant."
* This comes from Proto-Germanic **\*sangwaz** = "song."
* Related verb: Old English **singan** = "to sing."
* Further back: Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root **\*sengʷh-** = "to sing, make a vocal sound."

So English kept the *Germanic* inheritance directly.

---

### French **chanson**

* From Old French **chanson** = "song."
* From Latin **cantiō, cantionem** = "singing, song" (noun from **canere** = "to sing").
* Latin also traces back to the PIE root **\*kan-** = "to sing."

So French kept the *Latin/Romance* inheritance.

---

### Why they look so different

* **English "song"** is **native Germanic**, directly inherited from Proto-Germanic.
* **French "chanson"** is **Romance/Latin**, descended from Latin **cantio**.
* Both PIE roots — **\*sengʷh-** (Germanic branch) and **\*kan-** (Italic branch) — mean "to sing," but they diverged very early, before the split into Germanic and Italic.

---

✅ So: they *are related in meaning*, but not the same word-family. English “song” is Germanic; French “chanson” is Romance. They both go back to different PIE singing roots.

Fun fact: English also *borrowed* from French, which is why we have **“chant”** and **“chanson”** (rarely used, but poetic) alongside the native “song.”

Would you like me to dig up some **cognates across other Indo-European languages** (like Sanskrit, Greek, or Celtic) to show how those two PIE roots split?
