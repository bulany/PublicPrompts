Who was King David from the bible? What year and where was he born? What language did he speak? Can you give me a rough chronology of his life including the story about how Psalm 23 came about (at what time of his life did he write it and why? Did he write it down or did other people record it and how did it eventually end up in the bible?) Did he write any other Psalms or passages that are included in modern editions of the Bible?
