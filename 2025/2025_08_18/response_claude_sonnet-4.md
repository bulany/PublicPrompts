King David is one of the most significant figures in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, traditionally considered the greatest king of ancient Israel and a central figure in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions.

## Birth and Background

David was likely born around 1040-1000 BCE in Bethlehem, in the territory of Judah. The biblical account describes him as the youngest son of Jesse, a farmer and sheep owner. He would have spoken Hebrew, the primary language of the Israelites during this period, though he may have also known some Aramaic and possibly Philistine dialects given the political context of his time.

## Chronology of David's Life

**Youth (c. 1040-1010 BCE):** David began as a shepherd boy in Bethlehem. According to 1 Samuel, the prophet Samuel secretly anointed him as the future king while Saul was still ruling. David gained fame by defeating the Philistine giant Goliath and subsequently served in King Saul's court as a musician and warrior.

**Fugitive years (c. 1010-1003 BCE):** When Saul became jealous and tried to kill him, David fled and lived as an outlaw in the wilderness of Judea, gathering followers and evading Saul's pursuit.

**King of Judah (c. 1003-996 BCE):** After Saul's death, David was crowned king over the southern tribe of Judah in Hebron.

**King of united Israel (c. 996-961 BCE):** David eventually became king over all twelve tribes of Israel, conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital, and established a powerful kingdom that extended from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River and beyond.

## Psalm 23 and David's Literary Legacy

Psalm 23 ("The Lord is my shepherd") is traditionally attributed to David, and many scholars believe it likely reflects his experiences as both a literal shepherd and as someone who experienced God's protection during his fugitive years. The pastoral imagery and themes of divine protection in dangerous places align well with David's early life experiences and his time hiding from Saul in the wilderness.

Regarding its composition and preservation: In ancient Israel, poetry and songs were primarily oral traditions initially. David, described as skilled with the lyre, would have composed and performed his psalms. The process of writing them down likely occurred later, possibly during David's reign when he established more formal court records, or during the subsequent reigns of Solomon and later kings when scribal traditions became more established.

The psalms were eventually collected and compiled over several centuries, with the final form of the Book of Psalms taking shape during or after the Babylonian exile (6th-5th centuries BCE). This collection process involved scribes and religious authorities who preserved what they believed to be authentic Davidic compositions alongside other psalmic traditions.

## Other Biblical Writings

David is traditionally credited with authoring approximately 73 of the 150 psalms in the Book of Psalms, including:
- Psalm 3 (written during his flight from his son Absalom)
- Psalm 18 (a victory song)
- Psalm 51 (his confession after the Bathsheba affair)
- Psalm 23 (the famous shepherd psalm)
- Many others expressing themes of trust in God, repentance, praise, and royal responsibilities

However, modern biblical scholarship suggests that while some psalms may indeed originate from David's time or circle, others attributed to him were likely composed by later poets writing in the Davidic tradition. The attributions reflect the high regard for David as both king and psalmist rather than necessarily indicating direct authorship in every case.

David's legacy as the "sweet psalmist of Israel" (2 Samuel 23:1) established him not just as a political and military leader, but as a spiritual and literary figure whose influence on biblical poetry and worship traditions was profound and lasting.
