## The Story of Psalm 23

The beloved **Psalm 23**, which begins with "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," is widely attributed to David. While the exact timing of its composition is not specified in the Bible, many scholars believe David wrote it during his time as a fugitive from King Saul.

During this period, David experienced immense hardship, danger, and uncertainty, yet he also witnessed God's provision and protection in the wilderness. Drawing on his own experiences as a shepherd who cared for his flock, David penned this psalm as an expression of his unwavering trust in God's guidance and care, even in the "valley of the shadow of death."

It is believed that David, being a skilled musician and poet, would have composed and sung this and other psalms, likely accompanied by a harp or lyre. These compositions were then passed down orally and eventually written down by scribes and scholars. The collection and arrangement of the Psalms into the book we have today took place over several centuries, with the final form likely being established during the time of Ezra after the Babylonian exile.

King David is traditionally credited with writing a significant portion of the **Book of Psalms**. Of the 150 psalms in the Bible, **73 are explicitly attributed to him** in their superscriptions. These psalms cover a wide range of human emotions and experiences, including praise, lament, thanksgiving, and pleas for deliverance.

Some of the other well-known psalms attributed to David include:

* **Psalm 51**: A heartfelt prayer of repentance after his sin with Bathsheba.
* **Psalm 3**: A plea for help when he fled from his son Absalom.
* **Psalm 18**: A song of thanksgiving for God's deliverance from his enemies.
