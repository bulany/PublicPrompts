Great set of questions! Let’s go step by step and unpack what history, tradition, and scholarship say about King David.

### 📖 Who was King David?

David is one of the central figures in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. He was:

* The second king of Israel (after Saul).
* A unifier of the Israelite tribes.
* A warrior, poet, and musician, remembered as "a man after God’s own heart" (1 Samuel 13:14).
* The founder of a dynasty (the “House of David”) that later Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions connect to the Messiah.

### 📅 When and where was he born?

* **Date:** There are no exact historical records. Scholars estimate **c. 1040 BCE** for his birth.
* **Place:** David was from **Bethlehem**, a small Judean town.

This is drawn from biblical tradition (1 Samuel 16:1), not archaeological evidence.

### 🗣 What language did he speak?

David would have spoken an early form of **Biblical Hebrew**, specifically the dialect of the southern Levant around the 10th century BCE.
He may also have been familiar with some **Canaanite languages** and possibly **Aramaic**, which became more widespread later.

### 🎶 Psalm 23 and its origin

> *“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want...”*

* **When written?** Tradition holds that David wrote this psalm in his **youth as a shepherd**, reflecting his trust in God’s guidance.
* **Modern scholarship:** Some suggest it could have been composed later in his kingship, during a period of reflection or crisis.
* **Why written?** To express trust in God’s protection and provision, drawing on his shepherding background.
* **Did David write it himself?** Tradition says yes, but scholars debate this. Many psalms attributed to David may have been composed or edited by temple singers centuries later and ascribed to him as the great poet-king.
* **How did it end up in the Bible?** The Psalms were compiled gradually, probably reaching their final form during the Second Temple period (5th–3rd centuries BCE). David was remembered as the archetypal psalmist, so his name became attached to many works.

---

### 🖋 Did David write other Psalms?

* Tradition: **David wrote 73 psalms** (the superscriptions in the Hebrew Bible say *“Of David”*).
* Examples: Psalm 3, 18, 23, 51 (famous “Have mercy on me” after the Bathsheba incident), 103, 139.
* Modern scholarship: Some may go back to Davidic times, but many were probably written centuries later and attributed to him as part of Israel’s literary-religious tradition.

Would you like me to give you a **timeline with psalms matched to life events** (e.g., Psalm 51 after Bathsheba, Psalm 23 during shepherding, etc.), so you can see his life and writings side by side?
