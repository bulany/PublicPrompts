A very successful and productive charcoal artist suggests that possibly the number one thing an artist can do to improve their charcoal portraits is to work with the paper set almost vertically on an easel that puts the paper at eye height and work at arms length - ie don't work on a desk or on your lap and don't work too close. He theorises that working in this way seems to promote better accuracy and a much easier job of making a portrait of a reference photograph that he sets at a similar distance and orientation (ie vertical) to the paper and easel.
What do you think would be the main elements of why this might make drawing a portrait "easier" - ie quicker, more accurate and 'anyone can do it without years of training'.
His theory is that having a set up like this means there is less mental load of having to translate perspectives (e.g. a vertical refernce to a horizontal drawing on a desk) - there are risks of adding unintended foreshortening if you don't work this way and it makes the constant comparison easier.
I think his process is basically: make some 'fearless' marks, constantly compare and once the marks start to look like something you can more easily correct them to be a more accurate representation of the reference you are currently looking back to.
Does this make any objective sense?
Secondly, I was wondering if this setup could be enhanced at all in a relatively cheap manner. He uses a computer monitor mounted on a kind of arm so he can display his reference image and then move it exactly beside his drawing (matching the level etc)... I wonder if there is any simple kind of projection techniques that one could use to bring the reference onto the actual drawing surface... or maybe some kind of augemented reality app that does this kind of thing and so makes expressive drawing super fun, quick and expressive.
