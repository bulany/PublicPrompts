This approach makes excellent objective sense from several perspectives:

**Why the vertical setup works:**

The fundamental advantage is **visual consistency**. When your reference and drawing surface share the same orientation and viewing distance, you eliminate multiple cognitive translation steps that typically burden beginners. Your brain doesn't have to constantly convert between different spatial relationships - what you see is what you draw.

**Specific benefits:**
- **Proportional accuracy**: Measuring relationships (like "the nose is halfway between the eyes and chin") becomes direct visual comparison rather than mental calculation
- **Angle preservation**: A 45-degree jawline in the reference appears as a 45-degree angle on your paper, not something your brain must translate from horizontal to vertical viewing
- **Reduced distortion**: Working too close creates foreshortening effects - your hand movements appear larger relative to what you're drawing, making fine control harder
- **Better sight-sizing**: The traditional technique of holding a pencil at arm's length to measure proportions works optimally when you're actually working at arm's length

The "fearless marks then compare and correct" process is essentially how master artists work - it's iterative refinement rather than trying to get everything perfect from the start.

**Enhancement possibilities:**

**Projection options:**
- **Digital projectors**: A small portable projector could overlay reference lines or even a faint reference image directly onto your paper. Modern pico projectors are quite affordable ($100-300)
- **Camera lucida**: This historical drawing aid uses mirrors/prisms to optically superimpose your reference onto your drawing surface - modern versions are available

**AR possibilities:**
- Apps like "AR Drawing" or "SketchAR" can overlay reference images through your phone/tablet camera onto your drawing surface
- More sophisticated: iPad Pro with Apple Pencil could display a semi-transparent reference layer over your drawing app

The key would be keeping any overlay very subtle so you're still developing your observational skills rather than just tracing.
