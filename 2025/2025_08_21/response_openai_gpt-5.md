Yes — his setup and reasoning actually make quite a lot of objective sense, and it ties into several well-studied principles from perceptual psychology, ergonomics, and drawing pedagogy. Let me break it down:

### **Why working vertically, at eye level, and at arm’s length helps**

1. **Minimizes perceptual distortion**

   * When paper is on a desk, you’re usually looking at it at an angle. Your eyes + brain compensate automatically, but not perfectly — leading to distortions (e.g. foreshortening, skewed proportions).
   * By putting the paper vertical, you see both reference and drawing in the same perspective plane, reducing the cognitive load of translating between angled and upright images.

2. **Improves constant comparison**

   * Drawing is largely a game of *comparison* ("this nose is wider than that eye", "this ear lines up with the mouth").
   * When your drawing and your reference are side-by-side, same orientation, same scale-ish, you can make more accurate relative judgments without "mentally rotating" anything.

3. **Encourages whole-arm drawing**

   * Working at arm’s length lets you use shoulder and elbow instead of just wrist/fingers. This makes lines more fluid, confident, and proportionally accurate (since you’re less trapped in detail mode too early).

4. **Prevents “nose-to-paper syndrome”**

   * Beginners especially tend to work too close, which narrows vision and destroys the sense of proportion. Standing back forces you to see the drawing holistically, like others will see it.

5. **Fearless mark-making**

   * The physical setup encourages big, gestural strokes early, which are easier to adjust. That fits exactly with the “make fearless marks, compare, correct” workflow you described.

So yes, his theory that this setup removes a big layer of "translation work" is objectively valid. He’s basically streamlining perception → comparison → correction.

### **How this setup could be enhanced cheaply**

1. **Monitor on an arm (like he does)**

   * Already excellent. Just getting the photo and drawing surface at the same visual distance/orientation is a huge win.

2. **Projection (traditional)**

   * A cheap mini projector could project the photo faintly onto the paper itself.
   * Downsides: room needs to be dim, projector adds cost, and it can make you "trace" instead of *see*. Some teachers warn that projection can *bypass learning to see*.

3. **Augmented reality (modern)**

   * Even without AR glasses, you could use:

     * **Tablet overlay apps** → e.g. put an iPad or Android tablet on a transparent stand over your paper, running an app that lets you toggle between live camera and reference overlay.
     * **Phone AR apps** → there are already free “grid overlay” and “reference ghosting” apps that let you hold the phone up and see your drawing superimposed with the reference.
   * This could be playful rather than crutch-like, encouraging expressive drawing while still helping you stay aligned.

4. **DIY tricks**

   * **Transparent acetate sheet** over your drawing → lets you sketch alignment guides without marking the paper.
   * **Grids**: still one of the cheapest, most effective proportional aids (and they work even better when your drawing + reference are both vertical and side-by-side).

### **Big picture**

The artist’s method is about **reducing friction between seeing and drawing**. Every time you add a translation (angled desk, misaligned reference, working too close), you increase the mental burden. By making the setup "optically neutral," you free up brainpower for making good judgments — and that’s what makes it feel *easier* and accessible.

👉 If you want, I could sketch out (no pun intended) a few **practical AR/projection setups** that could be done on the cheap — e.g. with just a phone, a stand, and free software. Would you like me to do that?
