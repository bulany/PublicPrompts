Psalm 23 has been attributed to King David who I understand lived about 1000 years before Jesus Christ.
Does this Psalm appear in the Quaran and the Torah? Do Islam, Judaism and Christianity have common roots - what do they share and how, why and when did they start to split apart? Maybe you could give me a bit of a timeline and include information about the any common root languages e.g. I understand that the Quaran might be principally written in Arabic but was this always the case? Did the prophet Mohammed speak arabic? Does that mean basically everyone at that time and in that area spoke Arabic?
