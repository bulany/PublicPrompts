You're absolutely right that Psalm 23 is traditionally attributed to King David, who lived around 1000 BCE. Let me address your fascinating questions about these three Abrahamic faiths and their interconnections.

**Psalm 23 across traditions:**
Yes, Psalm 23 appears in the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh (which forms the basis of the Jewish Torah's written tradition) and is also included in the Christian Old Testament. The Quran doesn't contain the Biblical psalms directly, but it does reference the Zabur (Psalms) as a holy book revealed to Prophet Dawud (David). While the specific text of Psalm 23 isn't quoted in the Quran, Islamic tradition acknowledges the psalms as divine revelation.

**Common roots and shared elements:**
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are indeed called "Abrahamic religions" because they all trace their spiritual lineage back to Abraham (Ibrahim in Arabic). They share:

- Monotheism (belief in one God)
- Many of the same prophets and figures (Abraham, Moses, David, etc.)
- Similar ethical teachings
- Concepts of divine revelation, judgment, and afterlife
- Jerusalem as a holy city

**Timeline of divergence:**

*Judaism* emerged as a distinct monotheistic tradition around 2000-1500 BCE, crystallizing during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) when much of the Hebrew Bible was compiled.

*Christianity* began around 30-33 CE with Jesus's ministry. The split from Judaism occurred gradually over the first century CE, becoming definitive after the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE) and the Council of Jamnia (around 90 CE).

*Islam* emerged in 7th century CE (around 610 CE) when Muhammad began receiving revelations. Muslims view Islam not as a new religion but as a restoration of the original monotheistic faith of Abraham.

**Languages and the Quran:**
The Quran was indeed revealed in Arabic, and Muhammad spoke Arabic as his native language. However, Arabic wasn't universally spoken in the region. In 7th-century Arabia and the broader Middle East, there was significant linguistic diversity:

- *Arabic* was spoken by various tribes in the Arabian Peninsula
- *Aramaic* was widely used as a trade language and was the language Jesus likely spoke
- *Hebrew* was the liturgical language of Judaism
- *Greek* was common in Byzantine territories
- *Persian* dominated in Sassanid lands
- Various local dialects and languages existed throughout the region

The choice of Arabic for the Quran was significant partly because Muhammad was addressing Arabic-speaking communities, but also because Arabic became the vehicle for Islamic expansion. As Islam spread, Arabic became a lingua franca across much of the Islamic world, though local languages persisted.

The Hebrew Bible was written primarily in Hebrew (with some Aramaic sections), while the New Testament was written in Greek, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the early Christian world.

These three faiths represent both continuity and evolution in monotheistic thought, each building upon and reinterpreting earlier traditions while developing their own distinct theological, legal, and cultural frameworks.
