Great set of questions — you’re really digging into the deep history where language, scripture, and culture intertwine. Let me break it down step by step.

## 📖 Psalm 23 and where it appears

* **Psalm 23 ("The Lord is my shepherd…")** is attributed to King David (\~1000 BCE).
* **Torah (Judaism):**
  The Torah strictly means the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis–Deuteronomy). Since Psalms are in the *Ketuvim* (“Writings”), they are part of the Hebrew Bible (*Tanakh*), but *not* technically part of the Torah. So, Psalm 23 is Jewish scripture but outside the Torah proper.
* **Christianity:**
  Christians include the Book of Psalms in the Old Testament. Psalm 23 is cherished in Christian liturgy, funerals, and prayers.
* **Qur’an (Islam):**
  Psalm 23 does *not* appear verbatim. The Qur’an does acknowledge the **Zabur (Psalms)** as a revelation given to David (*Dawud*). Muslims believe David was a prophet, but the Qur’an does not preserve specific psalms; it references the Zabur more generally.

So: Psalm 23 is central in Judaism and Christianity, and Islam affirms the Psalms’ divine origin but doesn’t quote them directly.

## 🌍 Common roots of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam

All three are called **Abrahamic religions** because they trace their lineage (spiritual and sometimes genealogical) back to **Abraham**.

### What they share

* **Monotheism:** belief in one God.
* **Prophets:** figures like Abraham, Moses, David, etc. are honored across all three.
* **Scriptures:** belief that God reveals His will through sacred texts.
* **Ethics:** overlapping principles of justice, charity, care for the poor, prayer, fasting.

## 🕰 Timeline of splits

Here’s a broad sketch:

* **\~2000–1500 BCE**: Traditions about Abraham and Moses emerge; Hebrew language develops.
* **\~1000 BCE**: Kingdom of Israel under David and Solomon; Psalms composed.
* **\~600–400 BCE**: Hebrew Bible/Tanakh takes shape.
* **\~1st century CE**:

  * Judaism continues after the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE).
  * Christianity emerges from Jewish sects that saw Jesus as Messiah.
* **1st–4th centuries CE**: Christianity spreads across the Roman Empire, largely in Greek (later Latin).
* **7th century CE**: Islam arises in Arabia through the prophet Muhammad (610–632 CE).

  * Muhammad claims continuity with earlier prophets (Moses, Jesus, David, Abraham).
  * The Qur’an, in Arabic, is revealed.
* **Post-7th century**:

  * Judaism, Christianity, and Islam evolve into distinct traditions.
  * Sometimes they coexisted peacefully (e.g., medieval Spain), other times with conflict.

## 🗣 Languages

* **Judaism:** Hebrew originally; later Aramaic (by Jesus’ time, many Jews spoke Aramaic).
* **Christianity:** New Testament written in Greek (not Aramaic, though Jesus spoke Aramaic). Latin became dominant in Western Christianity.
* **Islam:** The Qur’an was revealed in **Arabic**.

### Did Muhammad speak Arabic?

Yes. Muhammad (570–632 CE) lived in Mecca/Medina (in the Arabian Peninsula), where people spoke **Classical Arabic**, the direct ancestor of Qur’anic Arabic.

### Did everyone in the region speak Arabic?

Not everyone.

* In **Arabia**, yes — Arabic dialects were the main language.
* In nearby regions:

  * **Aramaic** was still widely spoken in Syria and Mesopotamia.
  * **Greek** was common in the Eastern Roman Empire.
  * **Persian** was used in the Sassanian Empire.

So the Qur’an’s Arabic was both local (understood in Arabia) and elevated into a literary, sacred form.

✅ **Summary**:

* Psalm 23 belongs to Jewish and Christian scripture, not quoted in the Qur’an but Islam reveres the Psalms in general.
* Judaism, Christianity, and Islam share roots in Abraham, monotheism, prophets, and ethical teachings.
* They diverged historically: Judaism (\~2000 BCE onward), Christianity (1st century CE), Islam (7th century CE).
* Root languages: Hebrew → Aramaic → Greek/Latin (Christianity) → Arabic (Islam).
* Muhammad spoke Arabic, but in the broader region, Aramaic, Greek, and Persian were also widely used.

Would you like me to make you a **visual timeline/diagram** of the Abrahamic religions, showing the languages and key moments when they branched? That might help connect all the dots at a glance.
