That's a fascinating observation about the phonetic similarity! However, "psalm" and "song" actually have completely different etymological origins despite their similar sounds.

"Psalm" comes from Greek "psalmos" (ψαλμός), which originally meant "a song sung to a harp" or "a plucking of strings." This Greek word derives from the verb "psallein" meaning "to pluck" or "to play a stringed instrument." The French "psaume" is a direct descendant of the Latin "psalmus," which borrowed the Greek term.

"Song," on the other hand, comes from Old English "sang," which traces back to the Proto-Germanic "*sangwaz." This Germanic root is related to the verb "to sing" and has cognates in other Germanic languages like German "Sang" and Dutch "zang."

So while the French "psaume" does sound remarkably similar to "song," this appears to be purely coincidental - what linguists call a "false friend." The words traveled completely different paths through language families (Greek/Latin vs. Germanic) to arrive at their modern forms.

It's worth noting that both words do relate to musical expression, which might make the similarity seem less random, but etymologically they're unrelated. This kind of phonetic convergence happens fairly often across languages and can create some interesting coincidences!
