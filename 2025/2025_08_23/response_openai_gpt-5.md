Yes — you’re picking up on a real historical connection.

The English word **psalm** and the French **psaume** both ultimately come from **Ancient Greek ψαλμός (psalmos)**. That Greek word meant *“the twanging of a harp string, a song sung to harp music”*.

* **ψάλλειν (psallein)** = “to pluck, to play a stringed instrument”
* **ψαλμός (psalmos)** = “a plucking,” then by extension “a song sung with instrumental accompaniment.”

From Greek, the word passed into Latin as *psalmus*, then Old French as *saume* → modern French *psaume*, and into Old English as *sealm* → modern English *psalm*.

So yes: a **psalm is literally a type of “song”**, but specifically one sung to stringed accompaniment. That’s why the Book of Psalms in the Bible is essentially a collection of sacred songs or hymns.

As for **English “song”**, that’s from a completely different root: Old English *sang* (past tense of *singan* “to sing”), from Proto-Germanic *sangwaz*, going back to Proto-Indo-European *sengʷh-* (“to sing”).

👉 So “psalm” and “song” are **not directly related** etymologically, but they converge in meaning: both are about singing. The similarity in sound between French *psaume* and English *song* is coincidental — but the concept overlap is real, since a *psalm* is a special kind of song.

Would you like me to trace if the Greek *psalmos* and the PIE root of *sing/song* might share a deeper Indo-European ancestry?
