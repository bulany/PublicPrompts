"Le rétable de Grünewald" refers to the Isenheim Altarpiece (in German: Isenheimer Altar), one of the most famous and powerful works of German Renaissance art. Let me break this down for you:

**What "rétable" means:**
A "rétable" is the French word for an altarpiece - a decorative screen, painting, or sculpture placed behind or above an altar in a church. The word comes from Latin "retro-tabulum," meaning "behind the table" (the altar table).

**The artwork itself:**
This is not a story but rather a monumental painted altarpiece created by Matthias Grünewald (c. 1470-1528) between 1512 and 1516. It was commissioned for the monastery of Saint Anthony in Isenheim, Alsace (now in France, but then part of the Holy Roman Empire).

**What it depicts and its significance:**
The altarpiece consists of multiple panels that can be opened and closed, showing different scenes depending on the liturgical season. The most famous panel depicts the Crucifixion with extraordinary emotional intensity and graphic realism - Christ's body is shown covered in wounds, stretched and tortured, with a greenish pallor suggesting death and decay.

**Who it's significant to:**
- **Art historians** consider it a masterpiece of German Renaissance art and one of the most emotionally powerful religious paintings ever created
- **Medical historians** because it was displayed in a monastery hospital that treated patients with ergotism (Saint Anthony's Fire), a disease that caused gangrene and hallucinations - the graphic depiction of suffering resonated with patients' experiences
- **Religious communities** as a profound meditation on suffering, redemption, and resurrection
- **The broader public** as one of the most psychologically intense works of Western art

The altarpiece is now housed in the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, France, and remains one of the most studied and emotionally affecting works of religious art in history.
