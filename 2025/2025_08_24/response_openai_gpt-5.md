Great question — let’s unpack this step by step!

### 1. What is *le rétable de Grünewald*?

In French, *le Retable d’Issenheim* (sometimes called *le rétable de Grünewald*) refers to a famous **altarpiece** painted by **Matthias Grünewald** (c. 1470–1528), a German Renaissance painter.

* It was created between **1512 and 1516** for the monastery of the Antonine monks at **Issenheim**, in Alsace (then part of the Holy Roman Empire, now in France).
* The altarpiece is a **polyptych** (a large, multi-paneled work with hinged wings that can open and close to reveal different scenes).

### 2. What does “rétable” mean?

The French word **rétable** means **altarpiece** — a decorated structure (painting, carving, or both) placed **behind an altar** in a church. It comes from the Latin *retro tabula* (“behind the altar board”).
So, “le rétable de Grünewald” = “Grünewald’s altarpiece.”

### 3. What is shown in the altarpiece?

The *Retable d’Issenheim* is remarkable because it can be opened in different stages, revealing different layers of paintings:

* **Closed view** → a harrowing, almost grotesque Crucifixion, where Christ is shown suffering with plague-like wounds.
* **First opening** → scenes of joy and salvation: the Annunciation, the Concert of Angels and Nativity, and the Resurrection.
* **Second opening** → statues carved by Nikolaus of Hagenau (not Grünewald) and scenes of St. Anthony (the patron saint of the monastery).

### 4. Is it a story?

Not exactly one continuous story, but a **collection of biblical episodes** (Crucifixion, Resurrection, Annunciation, etc.), plus depictions of saints important to the Antonine monks. It’s meant as a **visual meditation tool** for prayer and liturgy.

---

### 5. When did it happen & what did it mean?

* Painted **1512–1516**.
* The monastery at Issenheim specialized in caring for patients with a horrible skin disease (ergotism, nicknamed “St. Anthony’s fire,” caused by eating rye infected with a fungus).
* Grünewald painted Christ’s body covered in sores and twisted with pain — so patients could **see their own suffering reflected in Christ** and find spiritual consolation.

---

### 6. Who is it significant to?

* **The Antonine monks** and their patients → it gave them hope, healing, and meaning in suffering.
* **Art historians** → it’s one of the greatest masterpieces of Northern Renaissance art.
* **Religious thinkers** → it powerfully communicates Christian themes of suffering, redemption, and resurrection.
* Today, it’s preserved in the **Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, France**, and remains hugely significant in both art history and theology.

✅ In short:
The *rétable de Grünewald* (Issenheim Altarpiece) is a monumental **altarpiece**, not a “story” but a series of painted scenes, created around 1515 by Matthias Grünewald. It meant comfort for sick patients, expressed the idea that Christ shared in human suffering, and today stands as a key work of European art.

Do you want me to show you how the panels looked when opened and closed (a kind of visual diagram), or would you rather I describe them in words?
