I was playing a Yamaha P-45 electric keyboard. It seemed to work fine but no matter which instrument I chose with the function button the velocity control didn't seem to work - no matter how softly I pressed a key the note would sound at maximum volume. Does the P-45 have velocity sensitivity? Could this be a hardware problem or could it be how somehow the software settings got upset? It wasn't plugged into anything via midi... power, the sustain pedal and an audio out jack were the only connections.
