Yes, the Yamaha P-45 does have velocity sensitivity (touch sensitivity) - it's one of its key features as a digital piano. The fact that all notes are playing at maximum volume regardless of how softly you press the keys definitely indicates a problem.

This could be either a hardware or software issue:

**Software/Settings Issues:**
- The P-45 has a "Touch" setting that can be adjusted. Try pressing and holding the "Grand Piano/Function" button while pressing the highest white key (C) to cycle through touch sensitivity settings: Hard, Medium, Soft, or Fixed. If it's set to "Fixed," that would explain why all notes play at the same volume.
- Some voices on the P-45 might have different velocity response characteristics, though this wouldn't completely eliminate velocity sensitivity.

**Hardware Issues:**
- The velocity sensors under the keys could be malfunctioning. These sensors detect how quickly the key moves down to determine velocity.
- Internal connections to the velocity sensing system could be loose or damaged.
- The main circuit board could have issues processing velocity data.

**Quick troubleshooting steps:**
1. Check the touch sensitivity setting first (most likely culprit)
2. Try a factory reset: turn off the instrument, then turn it on while holding down the highest white key
3. Test different voices to see if the problem affects all sounds
4. Try different areas of the keyboard to see if it's isolated to certain keys

If adjusting the touch setting doesn't fix it and a factory reset doesn't help, it's likely a hardware issue that would need professional repair.
