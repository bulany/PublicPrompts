Yes, the Yamaha P-45 digital piano absolutely has velocity sensitivity, which Yamaha refers to as "Touch Sensitivity." The issue you're experiencing, where every note sounds at maximum volume regardless of how hard you press the key, is almost certainly a software setting that has been inadvertently changed, not a hardware problem.

The P-45 has four different touch sensitivity settings:

* **Soft:** A lighter touch will produce a louder sound.
* **Medium:** This is the default and most standard piano-like response.
* **Hard:** You'll need to press the keys with more force to achieve a louder sound.
* **Fixed:** This setting disables velocity sensitivity entirely, causing all notes to sound at the same volume.

It sounds like your keyboard has been set to the "Fixed" setting.

### How to Fix It

To reactive the velocity sensitivity, you'll need to adjust the Touch Sensitivity setting. Here's how:

1.  Press and hold the **[GRAND PIANO/FUNCTION]** button.
2.  While holding the function button, press one of the following keys to select your desired sensitivity level:
    * For **Soft** sensitivity, press the **A#2** key.
    * For **Medium** sensitivity, press the **B2** key.
    * For **Hard** sensitivity, press the **C3** key.



To resolve the issue you're facing, you'll want to select either the Soft, Medium, or Hard setting. Medium is the default and a good starting point.

In the rare event that adjusting the touch sensitivity doesn't resolve the issue, you can perform a factory reset. To do this, turn off the piano, then press and hold the highest white key while turning the power back on.
