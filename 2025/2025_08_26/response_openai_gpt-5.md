Yes â€” the **Yamaha P-45 absolutely does have velocity sensitivity** (graded hammer standard, so the keys respond differently depending on how hard/soft you strike them). What you describe â€” every note sounding at maximum regardless of touch â€” is not normal behavior.

Here are the main possibilities:

---

### 1. **Touch Sensitivity Setting**

* The P-45 has a built-in function to adjust or disable velocity response.
* You can set the **"Touch"** parameter to:

  * **Hard** (requires harder playing for loud sounds)
  * **Medium** (default, natural response)
  * **Soft** (produces louder sound even with gentle touch)
  * **Fixed** (velocity sensitivity disabled â€” all notes sound at the same volume)

If your P-45 got set to **Fixed**, it will behave exactly like you describe.

ðŸ‘‰ To change it:

* Hold down the **\[GRAND PIANO/FUNCTION]** button and press a key in the lowest octave:

  * A1 = Fixed
  * Aâ™¯1 = Soft
  * B1 = Medium (default)
  * C2 = Hard

Set it back to **B1 (Medium)** and test again.

### 2. **Hardware Issue**

If changing the setting doesnâ€™t fix it:

* A problem with the **keybed sensor strip** could cause velocity not to register, defaulting to max.
* Usually this happens only if the unit has been exposed to moisture, dust, or heavy wear.

### 3. **Not a MIDI Issue**

Since you werenâ€™t connected to MIDI, we can rule out an external device forcing velocity = 127.

âœ… **Most likely explanation:** The "Touch" setting was accidentally switched to **Fixed** mode â€” easy to do without realizing when using the function button.

Would you like me to walk you through exactly how to check and reset all the P-45â€™s settings back to factory defaults? That way we can confirm itâ€™s not a hardware problem.
