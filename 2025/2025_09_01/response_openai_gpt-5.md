Great set of questions — you’ve touched on several different traditions, scientific studies, and practices (Wim Hof, yogic pranayama, modern meditation, freediving). Let me break this down carefully:

---

### 1. Why Wim Hof and Shivarasa recommend this specific program

* **3 cycles of 30 breaths + breath holds** is the **core Wim Hof Method protocol**, which he popularized starting in the 2000s.
* The rhythm is very similar to yogic **pranayama** practices such as *kapalabhati* (“skull-shining breath,” forceful exhalations) and *kumbhaka* (breath retention).
* 30 breaths over \~2 minutes (slightly hyperventilating) → temporary drop in CO₂ → easier and longer breath holds.
* Then a timed hold (60s → 90s) → a mild, controlled stress response and training for breath awareness.
* The numbers (30, 60s, 90s) are not “magic,” but they’re practical:

  * 30 breaths reliably lowers CO₂ enough for most people to hold their breath safely for about a minute.
  * The progression (60s → 90s) builds confidence and tolerance without overstraining beginners.

So: it’s partly **practical teaching design** (easy to follow, reproducible), partly drawn from **older yogic patterns**, and partly **tested by experience**.

### 2. Scientific basis & benefits

There’s been some research into the Wim Hof Method:

* **Respiratory alkalosis**: Hyperventilation lowers CO₂ in the blood, making it more alkaline (higher pH). This is probably what Shivarasa means by “alkalising.”
* **Breath-hold hypoxia**: Holding the breath after an exhale gradually lowers oxygen. This combination (alkalosis + hypoxia) triggers adaptations in circulation, stress hormones, and immune response.
* **Studies**:

  * Kox et al. (PNAS, 2014) showed Wim Hof practitioners could influence their immune response (less inflammation after endotoxin injection).
  * Others have found increases in adrenaline, reduced perception of pain, and improved stress resilience.
* **Subjective benefits**: Many report calmness, mental clarity, and emotional release.

So yes — **breathwork + meditation can be beneficial** in stress reduction, focus, and possibly immune modulation.

### 3. Breath holding: exhale vs inhale

* **Freedivers** almost always hold their breath after a full inhale (so they start with maximum lung oxygen).
* Wim Hof’s technique uses a **breath hold after exhalation**, which feels very different.

  * Exhale-holds emphasize the *low-oxygen*, *low-pressure* state (meditative, inward-focused).
  * Inhale-holds emphasize maximizing performance and oxygen reserves (practical for diving).

So, they’re serving different goals: **inner awareness vs. performance**.

### 4. CO₂, acidity, alkalinity

* CO₂ in the blood forms carbonic acid → more CO₂ = more acidic.
* Hyperventilation “blows off” CO₂ → blood becomes temporarily **alkaline** (respiratory alkalosis).
* During the hold, CO₂ rises again, gradually lowering pH toward acidic.
* Shivarasa’s “alkalising” comment likely refers to the state *after the breathing phase*, not after the entire hold. It’s a simplified way of saying: “Don’t worry if you feel tingling or lightheaded — your body is in a temporarily more alkaline state.”

### 5. Freediving methods & terminology

Freedivers use very structured patterns:

* **Breath-up**: the preparation phase (gentle breathing, relaxation, sometimes mild hyperventilation — though competitive freediving now emphasizes relaxation over aggressive hyperventilation, for safety).
* **Breath-hold / static apnea**: the hold itself.
* **Contractions**: involuntary diaphragm spasms that happen as CO₂ rises. Experienced freedivers learn to relax through them.
* **Recovery breathing**: controlled exhalations and inhalations after surfacing.

For a **5-minute comfortable hold**, freedivers usually recommend:

* Breath-up: 2–3 minutes of calm, diaphragmatic breathing (not too fast, not too deep).
* Final breath: a deep inhalation filling belly → chest → throat.
* Hold: relaxation, minimizing oxygen use (slowing heart rate, relaxing muscles).
* Safety: always practice with a buddy if pushing limits.

They’d generally *not* recommend Wim Hof’s strong hyperventilation pattern for freediving — it can suppress the urge to breathe too long, risking blackout underwater.

### 6. Health benefits: freediving vs Wim Hof

* **Freediving techniques**: optimized for maximum oxygen conservation and performance, not necessarily for daily health.
* **Wim Hof / Shivarasa style**: designed for stress relief, meditation, immune training, and altered states of consciousness.
* Both train CO₂ tolerance and vagal tone (autonomic nervous system balance), but the **intent differs**.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Wim Hof’s 30 breaths + 60s/90s holds are a practical, safe intro format, loosely inspired by yogic pranayama.
* Science suggests benefits: reduced inflammation, stress control, mental clarity.
* “Alkalising” refers to hyperventilation lowering CO₂ (raising blood pH).
* Freedivers aim for performance and recommend different preparation (inhale-holds, gentle breath-up).
* Both methods have benefits, but should be used in context: meditation vs. performance.
