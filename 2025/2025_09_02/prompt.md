I recently learnt about the story of Benjamin Franklin and his deliberate practice method for learning how to write really well. I also heard he pubished an outline of his "daily routine" in his auto-biography and would set an intention each morning like "What good am I going to do today?"
I like this idea and wonder if it would be a good one to apply to my own life but I'm wondering how much "good" to Ben Franklin really do given the big injustices of his era?
Could you give me a summary and timeline of Ben Franklin's life but pay particular attention to the conditions of the social class he came from?
Did his family own slaves and did he own or benefit from slavery during his lifetime?
I always seem to hear this kind of life advice coming from people doing well in life (ie not born into slavery for example)... do you know of any Ben Franklin types that came from less priviledged conditions?
Would you reccommend trying to set an intention every day and assesing that at the end of the day like Ben Franklin did?
But if so, how could that practice work toward freedom for everybody, not just personal freedom?
