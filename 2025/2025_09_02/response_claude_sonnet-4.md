Let me search for some specific information about Franklin's background and relationship with slavery to give you a more complete picture.Your intuition about the complexities of Franklin's story is spot-on. Let me give you a nuanced picture of his background and the slavery question, then address your broader questions about daily practices and justice.

## Franklin's Background and Relationship with Slavery

**Social Class Origins**: Franklin actually came from relatively modest circumstances. He was the 15th of 17 children born to a Boston candle and soap maker. His formal education ended at age 10, and he was apprenticed to his brother's printing shop at 12. So while not born into poverty, he wasn't from the elite either - more like middle-working class.

**The Slavery Reality**: Franklin owned enslaved people from as early as 1735 until 1790, purchasing at least seven individuals. He ran "for sale" ads for slaves in his newspaper, but by the late 1750s began arguing against slavery and became an active abolitionist. This evolution is significant - he went from participating in slavery to becoming president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery in his later years.

**Timeline of Franklin's Life** (1706-1790):
- 1706-1723: Boston childhood, apprenticeship, self-education through reading
- 1723-1730: Arrives in Philadelphia, works as printer, travels to London
- 1730-1750s: Builds printing business, becomes wealthy, enters public service
- 1735-1781: Period of slave ownership (coinciding with his rise to wealth)
- 1750s-1760s: Views on slavery begin shifting, influenced by education work with Black students
- 1780s: Active abolitionist, signs antislavery petition to Congress in 1790

## Your Broader Questions

The pattern you've noticed is real - much self-improvement advice does come from people who had certain advantages. Franklin's daily intention-setting happened during his period as a successful businessman who owned other human beings, which does complicate the moral framework.

However, I think there's value in adapting the *practice* while being conscious of its limitations. Setting daily intentions can work toward collective freedom if you frame the questions differently:

Instead of just "What good will I do today?" you might ask:
- "How can I contribute to justice today?"
- "What can I do to support others' liberation alongside my own growth?"
- "How can I use any privilege or resources I have responsibly?"

The practice becomes more powerful when it's explicitly oriented toward collective wellbeing rather than just personal advancement. Frederick Douglass, who came from the most oppressed conditions imaginable, also practiced rigorous self-discipline and daily learning - but always in service of liberation for his people, not just personal success.

Daily reflection can be a tool for accountability to your values, but the key is choosing values that acknowledge our interconnectedness rather than just individual achievement. What matters isn't perfecting yourself in isolation, but how your growth serves the larger project of human flourishing.
