Yes, Benjamin Franklin's story is complex, and it's wise to question the advice of historical figures in the context of their time. While he wasn't born into the elite, land-owning aristocracy, his position was still one of significant privilege compared to enslaved people or the Indigenous populations of the era.

Hereâ€™s a look at his life, his connection to slavery, and how his daily practice can be adapted for a more inclusive vision of "good."

### A Timeline of Franklin's Life and Social Standing

Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) was a prime example of a new social phenomenon in the American colonies: the self-made man from the **artisan class**. He was not born into poverty, but he certainly was not born into wealth or high society.

* **1706-1718: A Humble Start:** Franklin was born in Boston, the 15th of 17 children. His father was a tallow chandler and soap makerâ€”a skilled but modest tradesman. This placed his family firmly in the working, artisan class. He had very little formal schooling.

* **1718-1723: Indentured Apprentice:** At 12, he was apprenticed to his brother James, a printer. This was a form of **indentured servitude**, a common practice where one was legally bound to work for a master for a set number of years in exchange for training. While not chattel slavery, it was a restrictive and often harsh system. Franklin found it so unbearable that he eventually ran away in 1723, making him a fugitive in the eyes of the law.

* **1723-1748: The Rise of a "Leathern Apron Man":** He arrived in Philadelphia nearly penniless. Through incredible ambition, skill, and his famous self-improvement methods, he established a successful printing business. He proudly identified as a "leathern apron man," a tradesman who worked with his hands, distinguishing himself from the idle gentry. His success with the *Pennsylvania Gazette* and *Poor Richard's Almanack* made him a wealthy and influential man, but his origins were always in the working class.

* **1748-1790: Scientist, Statesman, and Abolitionist:** Having achieved financial independence, Franklin retired from printing to pursue science, invention, and public service. This is the period where he became a world-famous diplomat and a Founding Father. It was also during this later part of his life that his views on slavery evolved dramatically.

### Franklin's Evolution on Slavery

Your question is crucial: did he benefit from slavery? **Yes, he did.** The historical record is clear.

* **Early Life and Complicity:** In his early career as a publisher, Franklin's newspaper, the *Pennsylvania Gazette*, ran paid advertisements for the sale of enslaved people and notices about escaped slaves. He personally owned several enslaved individuals during his life, including Peter, Jemima, and King. For much of his life, he participated in and benefited from the institution of slavery.

* **A Gradual Awakening:** His views began to shift, likely influenced by his time in London and Paris, and his friendships with Enlightenment thinkers and abolitionists. He started to see the deep hypocrisy of fighting for American liberty while denying it to Black people.

* **Later Life as an Abolitionist:** In his final years, Franklin's transformation was profound. In 1787, he became the President of the **Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery**. In 1790, just months before his death, he signed and presented a petition to the first U.S. Congress, asking them to "devise means for removing this Inconsistency from the Character of the American People" and to "promote mercy and justice toward this distressed Race."

Franklinâ€™s life shows a man whose moral understanding grew over time. He was flawed and complicit in a great injustice, but he eventually used his immense influence to try and correct it.

### Inspiration Beyond Privilege

You're right to note that much self-help advice comes from positions of relative comfort. However, history is filled with "Ben Franklin types" who started with far less and achieved greatness.

The most powerful example is **Frederick Douglass** (1818-1895).



* **Born into Slavery:** Douglass was born into the brutal reality of chattel slavery, where he was considered property. He never knew his exact birthday or his father.
* **Self-Taught Against All Odds:** It was illegal to teach enslaved people to read and write. Douglass taught himself in secret, understanding that literacy was his "pathway from slavery to freedom."
* **Escape and Self-Invention:** After escaping to the North, he became a brilliant writer, a world-renowned orator, a bestselling author with his autobiography, and a key advisor to President Abraham Lincoln.

Douglass is arguably the ultimate American self-made man, as he had to first make himself legally *a man* before he could achieve anything else. His dedication to self-improvement was not for personal wealth but for the liberation of his people.

### Should You Set a Daily Intention? ðŸ¤”

**Absolutely.** Franklin's method of asking "What good shall I do this day?" and in the evening, "What good have I done this day?" is a powerful tool for intentional living. The key is how you define **"good."**

To make this practice work toward freedom for everyone, you can broaden the scope of the question. Instead of just personal productivity, you can frame it around collective well-being and justice.

Hereâ€™s how you could adapt Franklin's daily questions:

| Franklin's Original Focus (Personal Virtue) | An Adapted Focus (Collective Liberation) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Morning Question:** *What good shall I do this day?* | **Morning Intention:** *How can I contribute to a more just and equitable world today?* |
| **Evening Question:** *What good have I done this day?* | **Evening Reflection:** *Did my actions today align with my values of fairness and compassion? Who did I listen to? Whose voice did I amplify? In what small way did I challenge an injustice or my own biases?* |

This shift reorients the practice from a simple self-improvement hack into a meaningful exercise in social consciousness. It acknowledges that true "good" isn't just about personal success but about creating the conditions for **everyone** to be free and to flourish.
