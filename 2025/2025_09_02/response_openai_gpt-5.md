That’s a really thoughtful set of questions — you’re not just taking Franklin’s “life hack” at face value but asking where it came from, who it left out, and how something like it might be used today in a way that contributes to broader freedom. Let me break this down step by step.

## Franklin’s Background & Social Class

* **1706** – Born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father was Josiah Franklin, a candle- and soap-maker. This was a modest, working-class trade; Franklin himself was the 15th of 17 children. He did **not** grow up wealthy or elite.
* **Apprenticeship** – At age 12, he was apprenticed to his brother James, a printer. He learned the trade and later ran away to Philadelphia to escape what he felt was a stifling situation.
* **Rise to prosperity** – Through printing, Franklin became successful and eventually wealthy. By his 40s he could retire from day-to-day business and devote himself to science, civic projects, and politics.
* **Class climb** – He was not born into wealth, but he wasn’t destitute either: he came from a family of artisans who had some means, literacy, and connections. His “rags to riches” story often leaves out that he still benefited from being a free white male in colonial America.

## Slavery & Franklin

* **Family** – There is no evidence his parents owned slaves. His father was a Puritan artisan in Boston, where slavery existed but was less common than in the South.
* **Franklin himself** – In Philadelphia, he *did* enslave people in his household and print ads for slave sales in his newspaper. He benefitted economically from the slave system in that indirect way, too.
* **Shift** – Later in life (by the 1750s–1760s), Franklin became increasingly critical of slavery. In 1787, he became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Just before his death in 1790, he petitioned the U.S. Congress to end slavery.
* **Contradiction** – So: he participated in and benefitted from slavery for decades, but eventually shifted toward abolitionist views. The fact that this shift took so long reflects both personal blind spots and the entrenched racial order of his society.

## Timeline (with lens on class & slavery)

* **1706** – Born in Boston (artisan family).
* **1723** – Runs away to Philadelphia, works as a printer.
* **1729** – Buys the *Pennsylvania Gazette* (prints slave ads as well as anti-slavery tracts).
* **1730s–1740s** – Grows prosperous, founds civic projects (library, fire company).
* **1748** – Retires from printing, devotes time to science, politics.
* **1750s–1760s** – Owns enslaved people; begins to question slavery after exposure to Enlightenment thought and Quaker abolitionists.
* **1776** – Helps draft the Declaration of Independence (with slavery compromises intact).
* **1787** – Elected president of Pennsylvania Abolition Society.
* **1790** – Dies in Philadelphia, after petitioning Congress to end slavery.

## “Franklin Types” from Less Privileged Backgrounds

You’re right that a lot of self-improvement stories come from people who already had certain freedoms. Some “Franklin-like” figures from much more marginalized origins include:

* **Olaudah Equiano (1745–1797)** – Kidnapped into slavery, bought his own freedom, became a writer and abolitionist. His autobiography influenced anti-slavery movements in Britain.
* **Frederick Douglass (1818–1895)** – Born enslaved in the U.S., escaped, taught himself to read and write, became a brilliant orator, writer, and statesman.
* **Sojourner Truth (1797–1883)** – Born enslaved, escaped, became an activist for abolition and women’s rights.
* **Phillis Wheatley (1753–1784)** – Enslaved poet in Boston, whose published works challenged stereotypes and asserted Black intellectual life.
* **Booker T. Washington (1856–1915)** – Born into slavery, rose to become an educator and leader advocating for Black advancement.

These figures also used daily discipline, intention, and reflection — but under much harsher conditions, often explicitly connecting their practices to collective liberation.

## Should You Try Franklin’s Daily Intention Practice?

**Yes — but adapt it.** Setting an intention like “What good shall I do today?” and reflecting on it in the evening is simple and grounding. But Franklin often thought about “good” in terms of personal virtue or civic efficiency. You can expand the lens:

* **Personal + Collective** – Instead of only “what will make me better,” ask:

  * *What will make someone else’s life easier today?*
  * *How can my small action contribute to fairness or freedom, even indirectly?*
* **Scale down** – It doesn’t have to be grand: helping a coworker, supporting a friend, reading work by marginalized voices, donating time/money, or advocating for justice.
* **Reflection** – At day’s end, ask not just “Did I do good?” but “Did my actions help expand freedom, dignity, or understanding for others?”

This transforms Franklin’s method from just a self-improvement hack into a solidarity practice.

✅ **So my recommendation:** Try the daily intention + reflection method, but frame it in terms of *shared freedom.* Franklin asked, “What good shall I do today?” Maybe today we ask, *“What step can I take today toward freedom, justice, or dignity — for myself and for others?”*

Would you like me to draft a **modern version of Franklin’s daily schedule/intention framework**, rewritten so it explicitly works toward both personal growth and collective freedom?
