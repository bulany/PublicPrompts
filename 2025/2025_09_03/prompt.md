I want to try and create a handdrawn "flip book" in the corner of pages of notebook I have that has blank pages.
To assist with this I want to somehow draw the same identical grid of 9 squares (3x3) in the same spot at the top corner of 30 consecutive pages.
I wonder do you have any ideas of how I could do this without having to manually draw the lines for each grid on each page.
I'm thinking I could create some kind of a stamp... is there a way I could do this using things I already have around the house or are there ready made tools for this kind of thing at art shops?
