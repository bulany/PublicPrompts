You're absolutely right that a stamp would be the perfect solution for this! Here are several ways you can create one using common household items:

**DIY Stamp Options:**

**Foam/Sponge Method:**
- Cut a dense kitchen sponge or craft foam into a 3x3 grid shape
- Use a craft knife to cut away the squares, leaving only the grid lines raised
- Attach to a small block of wood or sturdy cardboard as a handle

**Cardboard Method:**
- Cut thin strips of corrugated cardboard for the grid lines
- Glue them onto a flat base (like a small piece of wood or thick cardboard) in your 3x3 pattern
- The raised corrugated edges will hold ink

**Rubber Eraser Method:**
- Use a large pink eraser and carefully carve your grid pattern into it
- Cut away the background, leaving the lines raised

**Ready-Made Alternatives:**

**Art Supply Stores:**
- Custom rubber stamps (most print shops can make these)
- Linoleum blocks for carving your own design
- Pre-made grid stamps (though usually larger than what you need)

**Household Hack:**
- Find something with the right grid pattern already (like the bottom of a small plastic container) and use it as a stamp

For ink, you can use a stamp pad, or even just dip your homemade stamp lightly in pen ink or paint.

The foam/sponge method is probably your easiest bet with household materials - it's forgiving to work with and gives clean lines. Would you like more specific instructions for any of these approaches?
