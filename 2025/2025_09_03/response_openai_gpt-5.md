That sounds like a great project! A little consistency in the "registration" of your flipbook drawings will really help the animation feel smooth. Here are some ways you could make that 3Ã—3 grid appear in the same spot on every page without hand-drawing it 30 times:

### DIY approaches (using things you likely have at home)

1. **Make a template (stencil)**

   * Take a piece of stiff paper, cardboard, or plastic (like from a cereal box or an old folder).
   * Draw your 3Ã—3 grid on it once, cut out the grid lines with a craft knife, and then use it as a stencil to trace quickly onto each page.
   * Bonus: if you tape the stencil to a piece of transparent acetate (or a plastic sheet), you can line it up precisely with the page corner each time.

2. **Carbon paper / graphite transfer**

   * Draw the grid once on a separate sheet.
   * Place carbon paper (or just shade the back with pencil) and trace over it on each notebook pageâ€”the lines will transfer faintly.
   * Then just quickly reinforce them if you want them darker.

3. **Stamp improvisation**

   * You can carve a simple rubber stamp from an eraser or a potato (classic DIY).
   * Just carve away the negative space so the grid lines remain raised. Ink with a stamp pad or even a marker, and press in the corner of each page.
   * Wonâ€™t be perfectly sharp, but it could give a fun hand-printed look.

4. **Printer shortcut**

   * If your notebook pages can be removed (or you donâ€™t mind cutting), you could print the grid onto translucent paper, then tape it back in, or use it as a tracing overlay.

### Ready-made tools you could buy

* **Rubber grid stamps** â€“ Craft shops sometimes have stamps with grids or lined patterns (often marketed for scrapbooking or journaling).
* **Stencil sheets** â€“ Art and office supply stores carry stencils (often for bullet journaling) with square grids and boxes.
* **Custom stamp** â€“ If you want to invest, you can order a custom rubber stamp online with your exact grid. Then itâ€™s just ink-press-done for each page.

### Low-effort trick

Instead of drawing lines, you could just make **tiny dots** at the intersections (using a stencil or stamp). Your eye will still see the 3Ã—3 layout, and you can animate within those guides without needing heavy lines that might distract from your flipbook drawings.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want the grid to be **perfectly uniform and faint (like a guide youâ€™ll draw over)**, or are you okay with it being **visible as part of the finished flipbook**? Thatâ€™ll help narrow down whether stencil vs. stamp is better.
