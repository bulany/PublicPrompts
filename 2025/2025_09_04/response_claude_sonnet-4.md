Yes, Benjamin Franklin had children and was married, though his personal life was quite complex by the standards of his time.

**Marriage and Children:**
Franklin married Deborah Read Rogers in 1730 in a common-law marriage (her previous husband had abandoned her, making a formal marriage legally complicated). He also had an illegitimate son, William, born around 1730-1731 to an unknown mother. With Deborah, he had two children: Francis Folger Franklin (1732-1736) and Sarah "Sally" Franklin (1743-1808).

## Franklin's Principles and Their Impact on His Family

Franklin was famous for his "13 Virtues" and structured approach to self-improvement, detailed in his autobiography. However, his success in passing these values to his children was mixed:

**William Franklin (c.1730-1813):**
- Franklin invested heavily in William's education and career
- William became royal governor of New Jersey
- **Major failure**: William remained loyal to Britain during the Revolution, creating a permanent rift with his father
- They were estranged for years; Franklin largely wrote William out of his will
- Despite Franklin's emphasis on moral virtue, their political differences destroyed their relationship

**Sarah "Sally" Franklin Bache (1743-1808):**
- Much more successful relationship
- She managed Franklin's household and correspondence during his later years
- Married Richard Bache in 1767 (Franklin initially disapproved but came to accept him)
- She embodied many of Franklin's values: industriousness, civic engagement, and intellectual curiosity
- During the Revolution, she organized women to sew shirts for Continental soldiers
- Franklin left her most of his estate

**Broader Influence:**
Franklin was more successful passing his values to protégés and the broader public than to his immediate family. His almanacs, autobiography, and public example influenced countless Americans. However, his frequent absences (spending nearly 18 years abroad) meant he had limited direct influence on his children's daily upbringing.

The tragedy of Francis's death deeply affected Franklin and may have made him more emotionally distant. His relationship with William shows that even his systematic approach to virtue couldn't bridge fundamental political and moral disagreements. Sally's success suggests that when Franklin was present and engaged, his methods could be effective, but his public career often took precedence over family life.
