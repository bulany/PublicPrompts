### The Influence of Franklin's Routines on His Children

Franklin's influence on his children was a mixed bag, and there is no evidence that his daily routines were a strong guiding force in their lives. His son William, a loyalist during the American Revolution, was estranged from Franklin. His daughter, Sally, had a strained relationship with him, especially after she married without his knowledge.

Instead of passing on his daily regimen, Franklin's influence was more apparent in his broader efforts to create a self-improving society. He founded numerous institutions, including the first public lending library in America and the University of Pennsylvania, which reflected his beliefs about self-improvement and public good. 

The success of his daily routines, as outlined in his famous autobiographical work, "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin," was more a testament to his own discipline and determination than a legacy he successfully passed on to his immediate family. His writings, however, influenced countless others over generations, who saw him as an embodiment of the American ideal of the self-made man.
