Great set of questions — Franklin’s personal life, his children, marriage, and his complicated evolution on slavery don’t always get discussed together, but they form an interesting timeline. Here’s a structured overview:

## 📜 Benjamin Franklin: Life Timeline with Focus on Family & Slavery

### Early Life

* **1706** – Born in Boston, January 17.
* **1723** – Ran away to Philadelphia at age 17, escaping his brother’s printing apprenticeship.

### Marriage & Children

* **1723** – Met **Deborah Read** in Philadelphia.
* **1724–1726** – Traveled to London; upon returning, Deborah had married another man who deserted her.
* **1730** – Entered a **common-law marriage** with Deborah Read (they were never formally married because her first husband’s status was unresolved). They lived as husband and wife until her death in 1774.

Children:

1. **William Franklin (c. 1730?–1813)** – Illegitimate, born before his marriage to Deborah (mother unknown). Raised by Franklin and Deborah. Later became royal governor of New Jersey, a Loyalist during the Revolution, estranged from his father permanently.
2. **Francis Folger Franklin (1732–1736)** – Son with Deborah. Died of smallpox at age 4. Franklin regretted not having him inoculated.
3. **Sarah “Sally” Franklin Bache (1743–1808)** – Daughter with Deborah. Married Richard Bache. She and her descendants carried on Franklin’s legacy; she became active in Revolutionary women’s relief work.

### Career, Public Life & Slavery

* **1729–1740s** – Successful printer, writer, civic leader. Owned slaves during this period, as did many middle/upper-class Philadelphians. Advertised slave sales in his paper.
* **1740s–1750s** – Increasingly influential in Pennsylvania politics and civic projects (library, fire brigade, hospital, academy that became Penn). Continued slave ownership but also began supporting education for Black children.
* **1751** – Co-founded the Pennsylvania Hospital.
* **1750s–1760s** – As a scientist, became internationally famous (electricity, Franklin stove, etc.).

### Shifts in Slavery Views

* **1758** – Joined the Quaker-inspired Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery (at first cautiously).
* **1760s** – Continued to own household slaves but published writings critical of slavery’s cruelty.
* **1770s** – By the time of the Revolution, had largely freed his slaves.
* **1787** – Became President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.
* **1790** – His last public act: petitioned the U.S. Congress to end slavery. He died the same year, April 17.

### Later Life & Family

* **1774** – Deborah died while Franklin was abroad in England (they had lived apart during much of his long diplomatic stays).
* **1776–1785** – In France as diplomat; very close relationship with Sally Bache by correspondence. He disowned William Franklin over Loyalist allegiance.
* **1785–1790** – Returned to Philadelphia; lived with Sally’s family. Supported her charitable works.

## 📖 His Daily Routines & Virtues

Franklin famously developed a **“13 Virtues” system** and a daily schedule (from his *Autobiography*), emphasizing order, industry, and moral self-improvement.

* He **did not strictly live by it himself** (he admitted falling short, especially on orderliness).

* **Children:**

  * **William Franklin** – No evidence he adopted his father’s system; their political split overshadowed personal lessons.
  * **Francis** – Died young, too early for such teachings.
  * **Sarah “Sally”** – She inherited Franklin’s sense of duty and civic service, running wartime relief efforts and raising a large family (7 children). Franklin’s values of industry and charity appear in her life, though not the rigid daily program.

* **Results for others:**
  Franklin’s “system” was more influential on **readers** of his *Autobiography* and *Poor Richard’s Almanack* than on his own family. Generations of Americans embraced his virtues as models of middle-class morality and self-discipline.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Franklin lived with **Deborah Read** as his wife from 1730–1774, but they were never formally married.
* He had **3 children**: William (estranged Loyalist), Francis (died young), and Sarah (his affectionate heir and family caretaker).
* On **slavery**, he shifted from being an owner and printer of slave ads to an abolitionist leader late in life.
* His **daily routine and virtue system** became a cultural legacy, but they were **not successfully transmitted** to his son William and only indirectly lived on through Sarah’s civic work.
