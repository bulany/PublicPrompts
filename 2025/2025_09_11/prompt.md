In a discussion about Ben Franklin's 'system' to live by I heard this:
```
  Franklin’s “system” was more influential on **readers** of his *Autobiography* and *Poor Richard’s Almanack* than on his own family. Generations of Americans embraced his virtues as models of middle-class morality and self-discipline.
```
It's possibly the first time I've heard of this phrase and concept "middle-class morality" but I am totally fascinated. I feel like it's like that Einstein quote and I'm a fish, finally seeing the water I'm swimming in.
In Ben Franklin's day I guess class boundaries were clearer with their being slaves, workers and ??
Are class boundaries just as clear today and I'm just not seeing the 'water'?
Can you give me a breakdown or a kind of "geography" of the different kind of classes and the traits of their various "moralities". 
Could you hazard as to why topics like one's class and the kind of morality that one ascribes to are not discussed more often amongst groups of people?
Could you point to any notable literature or even music and films that treat this subject with some rigour?
