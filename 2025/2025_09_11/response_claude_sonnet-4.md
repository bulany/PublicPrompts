You've stumbled onto something profound - the concept of "middle-class morality" as a distinct ethical framework is indeed like discovering the water you've been swimming in. It's fascinating because these moral systems often feel "natural" or "universal" when you're inside them.

## Class Structure Then and Now

In Franklin's era, class boundaries were indeed more rigid and visible. You had:
- **Aristocracy/Gentry**: Land-owning elites with inherited wealth and titles
- **Emerging merchant/professional class**: Franklin's own class - artisans, shopkeepers, early professionals
- **Laborers**: Free workers, indentured servants
- **Enslaved people**: Considered property, not even part of the class system

Today's boundaries are more fluid but equally real, just harder to see because we've internalized the myth that America is "classless." Contemporary sociologists often identify:

**Upper class**: Old money families, corporate elites, cultural gatekeepers
- Morality: Noblesse oblige, cultural stewardship, discretion about wealth
- Values: Tradition, exclusivity, "good breeding," philanthropy as duty

**Upper-middle class**: Professionals, executives, academics
- Morality: Meritocracy, cultural sophistication, "ethical consumption"
- Values: Education, achievement, social responsibility, work-life balance

**Middle class**: The core of Franklin's influence - managers, skilled workers, small business owners
- Morality: Self-reliance, thrift, hard work, personal responsibility, delayed gratification
- Values: Homeownership, children's education, "playing by the rules"

**Working class**: Service workers, blue-collar jobs
- Morality: Loyalty, solidarity, authenticity, suspicion of pretension
- Values: Family, community, practical skills, "keeping it real"

**Underclass**: Chronically unemployed, marginalized communities
- Often excluded from mainstream moral frameworks entirely

## Why We Don't Talk About It

Several reasons make class discussion taboo:

1. **The American Dream mythology** requires believing that class is temporary and changeable through individual effort
2. **Moral frameworks feel universal** when you're inside them - middle-class people often can't see their values as class-specific
3. **It's genuinely uncomfortable** - acknowledging class means acknowledging unequal life chances
4. **Cross-class mixing is limited** - we mostly socialize within our class, so differences remain invisible

## Literature, Film, and Music That Grapple With This

**Classic Literature:**
- Sinclair Lewis's *Babbitt* - devastating portrait of middle-class morality
- John Cheever's suburban stories - the anxieties behind middle-class propriety
- Richard Yates's *Revolutionary Road* - the violence of middle-class conformity

**Contemporary:**
- Joan Didion's essays on class and morality in California
- J.D. Vance's *Hillbilly Elegy* (controversial but illuminating on working-class values)
- Matthew Crawford's *Shop Class as Soulcraft* - philosophical exploration of working-class versus professional-class values

**Film:**
- Mike Leigh's British films (*Secrets & Lies*, *Naked*) - unflinching class analysis
- The Coen Brothers often explore class moralities (*Fargo*, *A Serious Man*)
- *Parasite* - brilliant recent exploration of class boundaries and moral frameworks

**Music:**
- Bruce Springsteen's entire catalog - working-class morality and its discontents
- Dolly Parton - complex navigation of working-class pride and middle-class aspiration
- Kendrick Lamar - sophisticated analysis of how class and race intersect in moral frameworks

The reason Franklin's system was so influential is that it provided a moral framework perfectly suited to an emerging capitalist economy - it made virtues out of the behaviors that would create wealth and stability. But recognizing it as "middle-class morality" rather than universal truth is indeed like seeing water for the first time.
