This is a great set of questions — you’ve stumbled onto one of those “invisible background structures” of society that shapes so much of our behavior, expectations, and even our sense of right and wrong without being talked about openly. Let’s break it down step by step.

## 1. What is “middle-class morality”?

When people talk about *middle-class morality*, they usually mean a cluster of values associated with striving, discipline, and respectability — things like:

* **Hard work** as a virtue in itself (the idea that work gives life meaning).
* **Thrift and saving**, often framed as moral obligations.
* **Self-discipline**: avoiding excess, controlling desires, “improving oneself.”
* **Respectability**: presenting oneself as sober, honest, and reliable in public.
* **Deferred gratification**: sacrifice now for reward later.
* **Education as upward mobility**.

In Franklin’s time, these were revolutionary because they framed morality not as noble birth or inherited honor, but as **habits that anyone could practice** to rise socially. His “13 virtues” project is basically a manual for turning moral self-regulation into personal advancement.

## 2. Class “geography” — past and present

### In Franklin’s 18th century America

* **Enslaved people and indentured servants**: legally unfree, denied access to “virtue” frameworks.
* **Working poor / artisans / small farmers**: survival-based morality, emphasizing resilience, cooperation, and craft pride.
* **Emerging middle class (merchants, professionals)**: Franklin’s audience, looking to climb, eager for a system of self-improvement.
* **Elite / gentry / aristocracy**: morality framed around honor, paternalism, reputation, “nobility” of birth.

### Today (simplified U.S. picture, but similar in many capitalist societies)

* **Upper class (wealthy elite, old and new money)**

  * Morality often framed around *legacy, stewardship, philanthropy*, and *taste*.
  * Avoids talking about money directly (money = vulgar, but *power* is fine).
  * Traits: networking, exclusivity, cultivation of cultural capital.

* **Upper-middle class (professionals, managers, highly educated)**

  * Morality centered on *achievement, meritocracy, and credentials*.
  * Traits: education obsession, health/fitness discipline, “work-life balance” (though often not achieved), strong belief in “earning” status.

* **Middle class (white-collar, small business, stable workers)**

  * Morality = Franklinian virtues: *self-reliance, respectability, hard work, thrift*.
  * Traits: homeownership as moral milestone, suspicion of both elite excess and lower-class “irresponsibility.”

* **Working class (blue-collar, service jobs, gig economy)**

  * Morality often centers around *loyalty, solidarity, fairness, and toughness*.
  * Traits: pride in “real work,” suspicion of pretension, moral weight on helping family and friends.

* **Poor / underclass (chronically precarious, marginalized)**

  * Morality framed around *survival, ingenuity, mutual aid*.
  * Traits: emphasis on immediate needs, community reciprocity, resourcefulness, sometimes seen by others as “improvidence” but really shaped by economic precarity.

*(Of course, these categories blur, and people carry multiple moral registers depending on context.)*

## 3. Why isn’t class morality discussed openly?

Several reasons:

1. **Cultural invisibility**: Like water to fish — norms feel “natural,” not chosen.
2. **Discomfort / taboo**: Talking about class threatens meritocracy myths (“we’re all middle class here” is the polite fiction).
3. **Shame and aspiration**: People often want to “pass” into a higher class, so acknowledging class-bound morality feels exposing.
4. **American exceptionalism**: Especially in the U.S., the story is mobility, not class hierarchy. Talking about classes feels “un-American.”
5. **Politics**: Class talk is often displaced into culture wars (e.g., “values” debates) instead of direct discussion.

## 4. Literature, film, music exploring this

### Classic literature:

* **Max Weber, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism***: foundational on how morality (discipline, thrift) tied to class and capitalism.
* **Thorstein Veblen, *The Theory of the Leisure Class***: about conspicuous consumption and elite morality.
* **Pierre Bourdieu, *Distinction***: how taste and morality are class markers.

### Fiction:

* **Charles Dickens**: obsessed with class morality, especially in *Great Expectations*.
* **Jane Austen**: class and morality are inseparable in her novels.
* **The Great Gatsby** (F. Scott Fitzgerald): contrasts old money, new money, and working-class values.

### Film & TV:

* *Parasite* (Bong Joon-ho): stark moral geographies of class.
* *The Wire*: very explicit about class moralities intersecting with institutions.
* *Succession*: elite morality, warped by wealth.
* *The Sopranos*: mafia morality vs suburban middle-class respectability.

### Music:

* Bruce Springsteen: working-class morality in rock form.
* Hip hop (esp. early 90s): survival morality, conspicuous consumption as resistance.
* Country music: working-class morality of loyalty, toughness, and pride.

## 5. To your question: Are class boundaries clear today?

They’re less *legally* rigid but still quite real.

* Housing, education, and healthcare systems *enforce* class distinctions without naming them.
* Morality is often what makes boundaries feel natural — “people like us” work hard / relax this way / care about these things.

So yes — the water is there. Once you notice it, you’ll see it *everywhere*: in how people talk about debt, food, schools, vacations, even how they judge “good parenting.”

Would you like me to make you a **visual “map” of classes and their associated moralities**, like a one-page chart or diagram? That might make the “geography” easier to see at a glance.
