Let's say I'm developing something with vue.js and typescript that has a lot of local resources say in the 'public' directory... is there an easy way of deploying this app-in-development to an iphone for testing in a way that the app can run on the iPhone offline. 
Like is there a way to run a node server or vite on an iphone and have it serve local content?
What are some really nice turn key solutions that allow you to get an offline app up and running on an iphone quite quickly?
