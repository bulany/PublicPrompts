Good question — deploying a Vue + TypeScript app to an iPhone **for offline use** during development is a little different than just testing it on a desktop browser. Let me break down the options, from easiest "turn-key" to more custom setups:

---

## 🚀 1. Wrap it as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**

* Vite + Vue already make it very easy to add PWA support (`vite-plugin-pwa`).
* Once installed and configured, you can:

  1. Build the app (`vite build`).
  2. Serve it once on your dev machine.
  3. Open it in Safari on iPhone and tap **Share → Add to Home Screen**.
  4. The app is cached locally and runs **offline** with all your static resources.
* Pros: Fastest and most lightweight path, no App Store signing needed.
* Cons: Limited access to native APIs, but for many web-only apps it’s perfect.

---

## 📦 2. Package it with **Capacitor** (recommended turnkey solution)

* Capacitor (from the Ionic team) lets you wrap your Vue app in a native iOS container.
* Steps:

  1. Add Capacitor: `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli`
  2. `npx cap init`
  3. Build your app with Vite → copy `dist` to Capacitor’s iOS project.
  4. `npx cap open ios` → opens in Xcode.
  5. Run on your iPhone (via USB or WiFi).
* Offline works by default since your resources are bundled inside the native app.
* Pros: Dead simple, offline by default, you can access native APIs later if needed.
* Cons: Requires a Mac + Xcode for iOS builds.

## 🛠 3. Use **Cordova** or **PhoneGap** (old school)

* Similar to Capacitor but older and less actively maintained.
* Still works for packaging web assets into an iOS app.
* Turnkey but Capacitor is the modern replacement.

## 🌍 4. Run it via a **local development server on Mac**

* You can run `vite dev` on your Mac, then access the dev server from your iPhone browser over the same WiFi (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:5173`).
* Pros: Zero setup if you just need testing.
* Cons: **Not offline** — requires your Mac running the server.

---

## ⚡ 5. Can you run Node/Vite directly *on* iPhone?

* Short answer: **No, not realistically**.

  * iOS doesn’t allow you to run background daemons like Node.
  * There are sandboxed apps (e.g., iSH Linux shell, a-Shell, Blink) that can run some command-line tools, but running a full Vite/Node dev server on an iPhone is impractical.
* If you want offline serving on iPhone, you need to bundle the app (PWA, Capacitor, etc.), not run Node there.

---

## ✅ Summary

For a quick **offline iPhone testing setup**, I’d recommend:

1. **If you want zero native setup** → Add PWA support with `vite-plugin-pwa`, load in Safari, install to Home Screen, test offline.
2. **If you don’t mind using Xcode** → Use **Capacitor**. It’s basically a turnkey wrapper around your Vue build, fully offline, and closer to the “real app” experience.

👉 Do you want to test this as a *real native-style app* (with an icon, splash screen, etc.), or is testing it as an **offline web app** (via Safari + Home Screen) enough for your use case?
