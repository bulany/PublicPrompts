The keys on a "flute traversiere" seem quite complicated. 
What is this instrument called in English?
When I look at a piano the notes are layed out from low to high and there seems to be a logical order to them.
Why is the flute not like this?
Or is there some order and organisation that I'm not understanding?
Can you play every single note (semitone) on a certain range on the flute?
Was the flute always like this? Surely it must have started simpler and gradually got more complex?
