I heard a story about a Saint Martin - the saint who famously cut his robe in two to give half to someone who needed it.
The story goes that he publicly decided to stop going to "conciles" becauase he found that "doctrinale discussions dimished his gift for miracles".
Can you explain who this Saint Martin was, what time and where did he live?
Does he have a "saints day" that is celebrated by the catholic church?
Do you know who might have told this story and what it means? (Like where would a story like this have come from?)
Do you think its a true story?
What are "conciles" and what did people do at them? Do they still happen?
What was Saint Martin's "gift for miracles"?
