In the context of the literature surrounding the effectiveness of "deliberate practice", that is practice that targets specific areas of compentence that take the performer slightly out of their "comfort zone", but not into the their "panic zone", can you suggest a daily practice routine and programme of not more than 10 to 15 minutes a day to attempt to make the following transformation:
Present situation: A seven year old flute student who can play the tunes Mary Had a Little Lamb and Twinkle Twinkle Litte Star in a basic manner, sometimes making mistakes and with not with a great "tone", sometimes its pleasant to listen and sometimes its not.
Desired situation: The same flute student is looking forward to and anctipating playing in a public busking situation. When the busking situation arrives they are confident and looking forward to the challenge. They play through their repetoire which consists of simple yet entertaining melodies and they are surprised to see the positive reactions of passers by in response to the music. This reaction sets up a kind of virtuous cycle where the student is very motivated to find the next situation where they can perform in public.
I initially thought it might be a good approach to just "throw them in the deep end" but thinking about it a bit more, this approach might be akin to putting them straight into their panic zone, with the result of them not wanting to play again.
Do you have some suggestions or comments?
