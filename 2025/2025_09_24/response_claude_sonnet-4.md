Your intuition about avoiding the "deep end" approach is spot-on. Throwing a 7-year-old directly into busking could indeed trigger panic zone responses that might damage their relationship with music entirely. Let me suggest a deliberate practice framework that builds systematically toward your goal.

## Daily 10-15 Minute Practice Structure

**Minutes 1-5: Technical Foundation**
- **Tone focus**: One long note held for 4 counts, focusing on steady, pleasant sound
- **Simple scales**: Just 5 notes up and down (C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C), emphasizing smooth transitions
- **Rhythm clapping**: Clap the rhythm of their known songs before playing

**Minutes 6-10: Performance Preparation**
- Play known songs 2-3 times, but with specific challenges:
  - Week 1-2: Play without stopping, even if mistakes happen
  - Week 3-4: Play while standing up
  - Week 5-6: Play facing away from music stand
  - Week 7-8: Play while someone else is in the room

**Minutes 11-15: Confidence Building**
- **Recording practice**: Record themselves playing (builds self-awareness)
- **Story telling**: Explain what the song is about before playing
- **Bowing practice**: End each song with a theatrical bow

## Progressive Exposure Ladder (Weekly Goals)

**Weeks 1-2**: Play for stuffed animals/pets
**Weeks 3-4**: Play for immediate family during dinner
**Weeks 5-6**: Play for neighbors over the fence/through open window
**Weeks 7-8**: Play in the local park (not for money, just for fun)
**Weeks 9-10**: Set up a "pretend busking" station in the front yard
**Week 11+**: Actual busking with parent support

## Key Deliberate Practice Elements

**Specific feedback loops**: After each mini-performance, ask "What felt good?" and "What would you change next time?" Keep it to one thing each.

**Gradual difficulty increase**: Each week adds one small challenge while maintaining previous skills.

**Intrinsic motivation protection**: Frame everything as "getting ready for your special concert" rather than correcting mistakes.

The beauty of this approach is that it builds genuine confidence through competence, while the progressive exposure prevents overwhelming anxiety. By week 8-10, they'll likely be asking when they can try busking rather than dreading it.
