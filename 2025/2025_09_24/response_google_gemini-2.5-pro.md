This is an excellent and insightful question. Your analysis is spot-on: simply "throwing them in the deep end" is a classic recipe for inducing the "panic zone," which can extinguish motivation. The deliberate practice approach you've outlined is the perfect antidote.

The goal is to build a "scaffolding of confidence" through small, targeted, and successful steps. The transformation from a hesitant private player to a confident public performer is not just about technical skill, but also about emotional and psychological preparation.

Here is a suggested daily practice routine and a longer-term programme designed for a seven-year-old, keeping the principles of deliberate practice and the 10-15 minute time limit in mind.

### Guiding Principles for the Parent/Coach

1.  **Be the "Warm Demander":** Your role is to be encouraging and positive (Warmth) while maintaining a focus on a tiny, specific goal for the session (Demand).
2.  **Gamify Everything:** Frame challenges as games or missions, not chores. Use sticker charts, a "practice superpower" of the day, or other rewards.
3.  **Process Over Outcome:** Praise the *effort* and *focus*, not just the "perfect" sound. "I loved how you focused on keeping your air steady that time!" is better than "That note was good."
4.  **Consistency is King:** 10 minutes every day is vastly superior to 70 minutes once a week. It builds the habit and embeds the learning much more effectively.

### The 10-15 Minute Daily "Music Time" Routine

This routine is broken into four short, distinct parts to maintain focus.

**Part 1: The Beautiful Sound Game (2-3 minutes)**
* **Goal:** Tone development (the core of a pleasant flute sound). This is the deliberate practice element for their sound quality.
* **Activity:** "Long Tones," but we'll call them **"Cloud Tones."**
    * The student takes a deep, relaxed breath ("smell the flower").
    * They play a single, easy note (like a B, A, or G) and try to hold it for as long as they can, making the sound as smooth, steady, and beautiful as a "fluffy cloud floating across the sky."
    * **The Challenge (out of comfort zone):** Can you make the cloud float for 4 beats? Now 5? Can you make the sound even smoother than yesterday? Can you make a "tiny mouse" (quiet) cloud and then a "friendly lion" (louder) cloud?
    * Focus on only *one* thing per day: e.g., "Today's mission is to make the start of the sound really clear, like switching on a light."

**Part 2: The Finger Puzzle (3-4 minutes)**
* **Goal:** Technical accuracy. This is deliberate practice for their notes and rhythm.
* **Activity:** Identify *one* small, tricky part from one of their songs. This could be a single note change that often causes a squeak, or a rhythm they stumble on. Isolate it completely.
    * **Example:** In "Mary Had a Little Lamb," the jump from A to G in "fleece was white as snow" can be tricky.
    * **The Challenge:** "Let's solve the A-G puzzle!"
        1.  First, just finger the notes A-G-A-G back and forth without blowing. Say the note names out loud. Do this 5 times perfectly.
        2.  Now, play it very, very slowly ($sloth speed$). Do this 3 times.
        3.  Now, try it at the normal speed.
    * This hyper-focus on a tiny "puzzle piece" allows for rapid improvement and a feeling of mastery without being overwhelming.

**Part 3: Play Your Hits! (3-4 minutes)**
* **Goal:** Consolidation, reinforcement, and fun. This puts the puzzle pieces back into a familiar context.
* **Activity:** The student plays the songs they already know ("Mary Had a Little Lamb," "Twinkle Twinkle").
    * This is their comfort zone, and it's vital for enjoyment and confidence. It reminds them that the hard work in Parts 1 & 2 leads to making music.
    * **The Challenge:** "Today, can you play 'Twinkle Twinkle' for your audience?" (The audience can be a favourite stuffed animal or doll). "Can you play it with the smoothest 'Cloud Tones' we practiced?"

**Part 4: The Performer's Bow (1 minute)**
* **Goal:** Building the "performance" muscle and ending on a high note.
* **Activity:** This is the critical link to the busking goal.
    * After playing their "hit," the stuffed animal "claps" (you can clap its paws together).
    * The student then learns to hold their flute gracefully to the side, look at their "audience," smile, and take a small bow.
    * This must be done *every single day*. It normalizes the act of finishing a piece and being acknowledged, which is a key part of performance anxiety.

### The Programme: A Phased Approach to Public Performance

This is how you gradually expand the "audience" and context over several months, moving the student from their comfort zone into the learning zone, and carefully avoiding the panic zone.

**Phase 1: The Bedroom Tour (Months 1-2)**
* **Audience:** Stuffed animals, toys, maybe a pet.
* **Venue:** The child's bedroom or practice space.
* **Goal:** Solidify the 10-minute routine and normalize the idea of playing *for* someone/something, including the "bow." Introduce a new, simple, and fun song (e.g., "Hot Cross Buns" or a simple folk tune).

**Phase 2: The Living Room Debut (Month 3)**
* **Audience:** One trusted and supportive family member (e.g., a parent, a grandparent on video call).
* **Venue:** The living room.
* **The Script:** Don't spring it on them. Say, "Grandma would be so thrilled to hear you play 'Twinkle Twinkle' after our practice today. We can call her and you can play it for her on the phone."
* **Goal:** Experience playing for a real, loving person. The key is that the audience is 100% supportive. After they play, the family member provides praise, and the student remembers to take their bow.

**Phase 3: The Family Concert (Months 4-5)**
* **Audience:** A small, invited group of 2-4 people (immediate family, a close friend).
* **Venue:** The living room.
* **The Event:** Make it a special "5-minute concert." They can prepare a "setlist" of their 3-4 songs. They announce the first song, play it, and you lead the applause. They take a bow. Repeat.
* **Goal:** Simulate a real performance arc (introduction, performance, applause, bow) in an incredibly safe and supportive environment. This is a huge step.

**Phase 4: The "Brave Busking" Adventure (When Ready, maybe Month 6+)**
* **This is not a test; it's an experiment.** The framing is crucial.
* **Step 4a: Location Scouting.** Go together to a park or a quiet pedestrian area. "Let's find a cool spot where a musician might play. Where do you think would be good?"
* **Step 4b: The Dry Run.** Go to the chosen spot *with the flute in its case*. Just stand there for a few minutes and imagine playing. Talk about it. "What song would you play first? It feels exciting, doesn't it?" Then go home. No pressure to play.
* **Step 4c: The First Song.** On a different day, go to the spot. The goal is to play **one song**. "Let's go on a music adventure. Our mission is just to play 'Twinkle Twinkle' one time for the trees and the sky, and then we'll pack up and get an ice cream. It doesn't matter if anyone listens."
* **The Setup:** Open the flute case (this is the "hat"). Play the one song. Smile. Bow to an imaginary audience. Pack up. Go get the ice cream. The reward is for the *bravery* of doing it, not for the quality or the public reaction.
* **Virtuous Cycle:** If this experience is positive and low-stakes, the child will naturally say, "Next time, can I play two songs?" The motivation will start to come from them. You have successfully created the conditions for the virtuous cycle you described.

By following this gradual, deliberate programme, you are building not just a flute player, but a resilient and confident performer. You are teaching them that challenges can be broken down into manageable pieces and that the feeling of mastery and sharing music is a profound joy.
