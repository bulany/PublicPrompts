You’re right to step back from the “throw them in the deep end” idea. For a 7-year-old, the difference between a *slightly stretching challenge* and a *panic-zone stressor* is huge. What you want to build is a *ladder of experiences* that develops technical skill, confidence, and the emotional “muscle” of playing for others — one small, pleasant, deliberate step at a time.

Here’s how a **10–15 minute daily programme** could look, framed around deliberate practice and the eventual goal of busking:

---

### **Daily Practice Flow (10–15 minutes)**

1. **Tone Warm-Up (2 minutes)**

   * Simple long notes on 2–3 pitches (middle register).
   * Focus only on producing the most beautiful, steady sound possible.
   * This builds awareness of tone quality, without pressure of “playing a tune.”
   * Variation: sometimes ask them to “play a note like honey” or “play it like the wind” — playful analogies help focus.

2. **Micro-Repertoire Spot Work (4 minutes)**

   * Pick one *tiny* tricky spot (e.g., a shift between two notes in *Twinkle Twinkle* where mistakes usually happen).
   * Practice it slowly, 3–5 times, until it’s clean.
   * Then re-insert into the tune and play the whole tune.
   * Goal: each day, one little wrinkle gets smoothed out.

3. **Performance Simulation (4 minutes)**

   * Student pretends they are “on stage.”
   * Play through one complete song (Mary or Twinkle) without stopping, even if mistakes happen.
   * Parent/teacher gives *audience-style feedback* — smile, clap, say what was enjoyable (not what went wrong).
   * Variation: record on a phone and play back for them to hear the improvement over time.

4. **Fun Repertoire Expansion (3–5 minutes)**

   * Add one “new but easy” song that is recognisable and fun (e.g., simple folk tune, “Hot Cross Buns,” or even a one-line pop melody simplified).
   * The goal is variety and a sense of *building a set list* for the imagined busking session.

### **Weekly Ladder of Challenge (comfort → stretch → prep for busking)**

* **Week 1–2:** Daily at home, with parent clapping as “audience.”
* **Week 3:** Play one song for a sibling / stuffed animals / grandparent on a video call.
* **Week 4:** Record a “mini concert” video and share with extended family.
* **Week 5:** Play one tune at school show-and-tell, or for a small group of friends.
* **Week 6:** Short “practice busking” in a safe, supportive spot (e.g., living room with a tip jar, or a garden with neighbours).
* **Week 7+:** Move toward a real busking moment — but framed as *fun performance play*, not a test.

### **Why This Works (Deliberate Practice Principles)**

* **Specific skill focus** (tone in warm-ups, tricky spots isolated).
* **Incremental stretch** (simulation → safe audience → real audience).
* **Positive feedback loop** (celebrating effort, not perfection).
* **Motivational framing** (songs chosen for recognisability and fun, building a “set list” for the busking fantasy).

The idea is to help the student feel *safe but challenged*, so that each new “audience” feels like the next natural step, not a scary leap.

👉 Would you like me to sketch out a **sample 2-month progression**, mapping specific repertoire additions + audience steps (like a training plan), so the child has a clear ladder toward their first busking outing?
