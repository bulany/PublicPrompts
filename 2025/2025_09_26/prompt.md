A man in his late 40s is complaining of occasional headaches and pain at the back of his head and maybe in neck. He describes experiencing frequent muscular tightness between his shoulder blades and in his neck. He often works about 6 hours per day (with frequent breaks) sitting at a desk working on a laptop computer and wonders if this is linked with these symptoms.
He would like to know exactly what causes the feeling of "muscular tightness" and if there are any effective remedies he can start applying gradually and straight away. He can't really change the ergonmics of his work situation for the moment, so if these long periods of sitting have anything to do with the headaches or tightness he would like to know if there's anything he can do about it.
His posture isn't great either. He would love to not feel tense in his upper back and neck but doesn't even know what it might like to feel other wise - is it possible to have a relaxed feeling upper back and neck? Is there a concrete way to measure such tension and know if it is within some bounds of "normal"?
He would love to have better posture also. What advice can you offer him?
