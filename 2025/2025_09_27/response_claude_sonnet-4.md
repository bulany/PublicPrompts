The uneven distribution of days across calendar months is the result of thousands of years of historical evolution, political decisions, and astronomical compromises.

## Why months have different numbers of days

Our calendar system traces back to ancient Rome, which originally had a 10-month calendar starting with March. The Romans later added January and February, creating a 355-day year that didn't align well with the solar year (approximately 365.25 days). Various rulers made adjustments over time, often for political reasons rather than astronomical precision.

The biggest shake-up came when Julius Caesar reformed the calendar in 46 BCE, creating what we call the Julian calendar. He distributed days somewhat arbitrarily across months, and later Augustus Caesar allegedly took a day from February to make August (named after himself) equal to July (named after Julius Caesar) at 31 days each.

## Could we make months equal?

Mathematically, yes. With 365 days, we could have 12 months of 30 days each plus 5 extra days, or 13 months of 28 days each plus 1 extra day. Several proposals exist:

- The **World Calendar** would have four quarters, each with months of 31-30-30 days
- The **International Fixed Calendar** proposed 13 months of exactly 28 days each
- A simple **30-day system** with 5 or 6 "worlddays" outside the regular month structure

The main obstacles are cultural inertia, religious calendars, business systems, and the fact that 365 doesn't divide evenly by 12.

## Why February got shortchanged

February's brevity stems from Roman tradition and superstition. In the original Roman calendar, February was the last month of the year and was associated with purification rituals and death - Romans considered even numbers unlucky. When calendar reforms happened, February consistently ended up as the "leftover" month where extra or fewer days were placed.

The Romans essentially treated February as the adjustment month. When Julius Caesar reformed the calendar, February kept its shorter length, and when Augustus allegedly took a day for August, it came from February again. February wasn't specifically chosen to be punished - it just happened to be the traditional place where calendar arithmetic got resolved, and that pattern stuck for over two millennia.

Changing our calendar system now would require unprecedented global coordination, affecting everything from financial quarters to religious observances to computer systems worldwide.
