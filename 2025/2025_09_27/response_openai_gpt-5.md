Great set of questions! Let’s break it down:

---

### 🌍 Why months have different numbers of days

* **Months are based on the Moon.** The word "month" comes from "moon." A lunar cycle is about **29.5 days**, so 12 lunar months would be about **354 days**—shorter than a solar year (\~365 days).
* The Romans, who gave us the modern calendar, wanted a solar-based year, so they had to adjust month lengths to make 12 months fit \~365 days.
* Instead of making all months equal, they mixed **30-day** and **31-day** months (and a weird February) to keep the total close.

### 📏 Could every month have the same number of days?

* **Yes, but not with 12 months of whole days.**

  * If we tried 12 months, each would be \~30.42 days, which isn’t possible with whole days.
  * You’d need some months with 30 and some with 31.
* Alternative proposals exist:

  * **13-month calendar (the "International Fixed Calendar")** → 13 months × 28 days = 364 days, plus 1 "year day" outside the months, and a leap day every 4 years. This makes months equal, but society never adopted it.
  * **10-month schemes** were also proposed in history, but they fell out of sync with the solar year.

So yes, you *could* have equal months, but you’d need either 13 months or special "extra days."

### 📜 Why is February shorter?

* **Roman calendar origins**:

  * Early Romans (around 750 BCE) had a **10-month calendar** starting in March (Martius). The year had 304 days, and the winter days weren’t even assigned to a month!
  * Later (around 713 BCE), **King Numa Pompilius** added January and February to make 12 months and reach 355 days.
  * Because odd numbers were considered luckier, Numa gave most months 29 or 31 days. That left **February with 28**, since the Romans also saw it as an unlucky month (it was associated with purification rituals and the dead).
* **Julius Caesar’s reform (46 BCE)**:

  * He introduced the **Julian calendar** with leap years and redistributed days.
  * Most months got 30 or 31 days, but **February stayed at 28 (29 on leap years)** to keep the tradition and symbolism.
* Later emperors (like Augustus) tinkered with month lengths, but February remained the oddball.

---

✅ **Summary**:

* Months are unequal because the solar year doesn’t divide neatly into 12.
* Equal months are possible only if we use 13 months or add "extra days" not belonging to a month.
* February is shortest because of Roman superstition and number juggling when they first expanded to 12 months—then Caesar kept it that way.

Would you like me to also tell you about some **real alternative calendar systems** people proposed (like the 13-month "World Calendar") and why they failed to replace our current one?
