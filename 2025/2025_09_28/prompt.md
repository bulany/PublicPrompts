The same man in his late 40s also feels its important to maintain a "stillness practice", that is, about 20 minutes of still meditation once or twice a day, focusing on breathing and relaxing.
He often finds that during this time (usually sitting cross legged on a flat surface) he can really feel that tension in his neck and back... he wonders if there is a way you can meditate where you feel great doing it and of course you feel great afterward.
He wonders, if the upper back and neck tension is caused by sitting for prolonged periods in the "laptop posture", is there a kind of "anti-laptop posture" he could adopt to kind of rebalance things. What would this posture look like and how long should he maintain it for daily? Would it be better to meditate like that than the standard cross-legged sitting posture. In relation to this he is also thinking about the hip flexors and maybe how he can passively balance out those from the laptop posture.
Finally what would be the "low hanging fruit" in terms of ergonomics in the laptop work situation, like what would be the three most effective changes to make?
