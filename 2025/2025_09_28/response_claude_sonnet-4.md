Your meditation observations are spot-on—sitting cross-legged can actually amplify the very tension patterns you're trying to release. Let me address each of your questions.

## Making Meditation Feel Great

The tension you feel during meditation isn't a sign you're doing something wrong—it's your nervous system finally relaxing enough to notice what's been there all day. However, you can absolutely find positions that feel better:

**Supported sitting**: Use a meditation cushion, bolster, or even a regular pillow to elevate your hips above your knees. This reduces hip flexor tension and allows your spine to lengthen naturally.

**Chair meditation**: There's nothing inferior about meditating in a chair. Choose one with good back support, feet flat on the floor, and focus on lengthening through the crown of your head.

**Wall support**: Sit with your back against a wall for gentle support while maintaining an upright posture.

**Lying down meditation**: If tension is severe, try lying on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, or with a pillow under your knees.

## The "Anti-Laptop Posture"

This is brilliant thinking. The anti-laptop posture would essentially reverse every aspect of hunched desk posture:

**Upper body**: Chest open, shoulder blades gently drawn together and down, head balanced over shoulders (not forward), arms relaxed at sides.

**Spine**: Natural curves maintained—slight inward curve at lower back, slight outward curve at upper back.

**Hip positioning**: Hips in extension (opposite of the flexed position from sitting).

**Practical "anti-laptop" positions**:
- **Prone (face-down) positions**: Lying on your stomach reading a book, or doing gentle backbends
- **Standing with arms behind back**: Clasp hands behind you and gently lift arms away from your body
- **Supine (face-up) with chest opening**: Lie on your back with a rolled towel under your shoulder blades

**Duration**: Aim for 10-15 minutes total daily, which could be broken into 2-3 shorter sessions. Even 3-5 minutes can provide relief.

## Hip Flexor Rebalancing

Your hip flexors are likely chronically shortened from sitting. Here are passive ways to address this:

**The couch stretch**: Place your back foot on a couch or chair, front foot forward in a lunge position. Let gravity do the work—this is beautifully passive.

**Supine hip flexor stretch**: Lie on the edge of your bed, pull one knee to your chest while letting the other leg hang off the edge.

**Standing hip flexor release**: Simply standing and walking regularly helps, but for passive benefit, try standing with one foot elevated behind you on a low step.

## Top 3 Ergonomic "Low-Hanging Fruit"

**1. External keyboard and mouse**: This is the single biggest game-changer. It allows you to raise your laptop screen to eye level while keeping your arms in a comfortable position. Even a basic wireless keyboard ($20-30) transforms your setup.

**2. Laptop stand or monitor riser**: Get your screen to eye level so you're not looking down. Books, a laptop stand, or even a sturdy box works. The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level.

**3. Document holder**: If you reference papers while working, place them at the same height and distance as your screen to avoid constant neck turning and looking down.

**Bonus quick wins**:
- **Laptop positioning**: Center the screen directly in front of you, not off to one side
- **Chair height**: Adjust so your feet are flat on the floor and your thighs are parallel to the ground

## Meditation Posture Recommendation

Given your situation, I'd suggest meditating in your "anti-laptop posture" for at least one of your daily sessions. Try lying on your back with a small pillow or rolled towel under your shoulder blades—this gently opens your chest and reverses the forward head posture. You can also try standing meditation occasionally, which naturally engages the muscles that support good posture.

The key insight here is that your meditation practice can be part of your physical healing, not just your mental practice. When your body feels comfortable and balanced, your mind settles more easily too.

Start with the external keyboard—it's the most impactful change you can make for the money and effort involved. Your neck will likely start feeling better within days.
