I've heard that phytoplankton in the ocean is responsible for most of the oxygen in the air we breathe.
Is this true?
If all the phytoplankton were to dissappear suddenly, how much time would humans have left before they would start suffering from lack of oxygen?
What is the minimum percent oxygen we need in air to survive?
Is the phytopankton that produce oxygen the same plankton that whales eat for food?
I often think that its good not to waste drinking water and look after drinking water because we need it to survive, but could you argue that looking after the air is even more immediately important?
Is it because air is invisible that I don't think about this more often?
Shouldn't we be really incredibly grateful for all the phytoplankton that are working hard to produce the oxygen that we use everyday to survive?
Are there any immediate threats to worlds populations of phytoplankton?
How should one look after and care for phytoplankton?
