In english we use the word 'good' a lot. We say "good morning" and "good night" and "g'day" (or "good day").
In english we also use the word "god"... are "good" and "god" related and if so, what is there connection.
It would make sense to me to wish someone a "god day" as opposed to an "evil day" or "devil day".
In French they say "bonjour" and they use the word "bon" for 'good'... does this have a similar connection with spiritual matters? The word "bon" seems very differnt to "dieu" though... these habitual phrases seem so similar to the english versions though... is there a connection?
