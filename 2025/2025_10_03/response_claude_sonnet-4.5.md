This is a fascinating question about etymology! Let me break down these connections:

## "Good" and "God" - No Direct Connection

Despite their similar spelling in Modern English, **"good" and "god" are not etymologically related**. They come from completely different roots:

- **"Good"** comes from Proto-Germanic *gōdaz*, related to "gather" - originally meaning "fitting" or "suitable"
- **"God"** comes from Proto-Germanic *gudą*, possibly related to "invoke" or "pour" (as in pouring libations)

The similarity in spelling is coincidental - they just happened to evolve similar forms in English. In other Germanic languages, you can see they're quite different:
- German: *gut* (good) vs *Gott* (god)
- Dutch: *goed* (good) vs *god* (god)
- Swedish: *god* (good) vs *gud* (god)

So "good morning" isn't spiritually invoking goodness over evil - it's more like wishing someone a "fitting" or "pleasant" morning.

## French "Bon" and "Dieu"

Similarly, **French "bon" (good) and "dieu" (god) are completely unrelated**:

- **"Bon"** comes from Latin *bonus* (good)
- **"Dieu"** comes from Latin *deus* (god)

The parallel structure between English and French greetings ("good morning"/"bonjour", "good day"/"bon jour") is because both languages independently developed the same logical pattern of wishing someone a pleasant time of day - but it's not because of any spiritual connection in the words themselves.

These are simply common, practical ways humans across cultures express friendly wishes!
