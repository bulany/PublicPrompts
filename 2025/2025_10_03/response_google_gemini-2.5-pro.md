That's an excellent and very insightful question! Your intuition is picking up on some fascinating coincidences in the English language and common patterns across European languages.

The short answer is that **"good" and "god" are not related**. Their similar spelling and sound in modern English is purely a coincidence. The connection you're proposing is a perfect example of what linguists call **folk etymology**, where a logical but incorrect connection is made between words.

Let's break it down.

***

## English: Good vs. God

The words "good" and "god" come from entirely different ancient roots.

* **Good**: This word traces back to the Proto-Germanic word *$g≈çdaz$*, which meant "fitting," "suitable," or "belonging together." The core idea was about things that fit well or are in harmony. From there, it became the Old English word *g≈çd* and eventually our modern "good."

* **God**: This word has a much different origin. It comes from the Proto-Germanic *$gudƒÖ$*, which is believed to derive from a Proto-Indo-European root *$«µ ∞ew-$*, meaning "to pour" or "to make a libation (a drink offering)." The original meaning of "god," therefore, was likely "the entity to whom offerings are poured."

So, while we might wish someone a "good day" (a suitable, fitting day), the word has no original connection to a divine being.

### The "Goodbye" Exception

Interestingly, there is a common English phrase where "God" is explicitly part of the greeting: **goodbye**. This is a contraction of the 16th-century phrase **"God be with ye."** Over time, it was shortened and smoothed into the single word we use today.

## French: Bon vs. Dieu

You're correct again that "bonjour" follows the same pattern as "good day," but just like in English, the words for "good" and "god" in French are unrelated.

* **Bon**: This comes directly from the Latin word **bonus**, which simply means "good." It has always been associated with quality, virtue, and pleasantness, with no spiritual connection.

* **Dieu**: This word for "god" comes from the Latin **deus**. This, in turn, comes from the very ancient Proto-Indo-European root *$dyeu-$*, which meant "to shine" or "sky." This is why the chief god in many ancient mythologies was a sky god (e.g., the Roman **Ju**piter and the Greek **Zeu**s share this same root).

So, "bon" is from Latin for "good," while "dieu" is from a root meaning "sky/shining one." They have completely separate histories.

## Why Do the Greetings Seem So Similar? ü§î

You are absolutely right to notice the similarity between "good day" and "bonjour."

* **Bonjour** = **bon** (good) + **jour** (day)
* **Good day** = **good** (good) + **day** (day)

This is a fantastic example of a **calque**, or a loan translation. It's a phrase borrowed from another language by translating its components literally. Wishing someone a "good day" or "good morning" is a common structure across many European languages, which developed in parallel and influenced one another over centuries.

While the *words* themselves ("good" vs. "bon") come from different language families (Germanic vs. Latin), the *idea* and *structure* of the greeting are the same. You see this in other languages too:

* **German**: *Guten Tag* (Good Day)
* **Italian**: *Buongiorno* (Good Day)
* **Spanish**: *Buenos d√≠as* (Good Day, plural)

So, your observation is spot on‚Äîthe phrases are connected in their structure and meaning, but the individual words for "good" and "god" within each language are not.
