Great question — you’re brushing up against the fascinating intersection of **etymology, religion, and everyday greetings**. Let’s unpack it step by step.

---

### 1. Are *good* and *god* related in English?

They *look* and *sound* similar, but historically they’re **different words**:

* **good** → from Old English *gōd*, meaning “virtuous, desirable, fitting.” It comes from Proto-Germanic *gōdaz*.
* **god** → from Old English *god*, meaning “deity.” It comes from Proto-Germanic *gudan* (linked to the idea of “that which is invoked” or “that which is worshipped”).

So, linguistically, they are not the same root.
But in **folk usage and sound associations**, people have often blended them — especially in religious contexts where “God is good” becomes almost a wordplay.

So your instinct ("good day" vs. "god day") taps into that natural overlap humans notice, even though they aren’t the same etymologically.

### 2. Why “good morning” instead of “god morning”?

When we say *good morning* or *good night*, “good” just means “pleasant, favorable, well.” But historically, English *did* have greetings invoking God, like:

* “God be with you” → which eventually contracted into **goodbye**! (via *God be wy you* → *godbwye* → *goodbye*).

So English speakers once literally wished God’s presence, but that phrase shifted over time into something that just *sounds* like “good.”

### 3. What about French *bonjour* and *bon*?

* **bon** = “good” (from Latin *bonus*).
* **jour** = “day” (from Latin *diurnus* → “daily”).

So *bonjour* literally means “good day,” just like *g’day*.
But French *Dieu* (“God”) comes from Latin *Deus* — totally different root.

So in French, the connection between “good” (*bon*) and “God” (*Dieu*) is even weaker than in English. The greetings sound parallel (*good day* vs *bon jour*), but they don’t imply God directly.

### 4. Why do greetings often involve “good”?

Across many languages, greetings developed from wishing someone something **positive for the day**:

* English: *good morning*
* French: *bonjour*
* German: *guten Tag*
* Spanish: *buenos días*
* Italian: *buongiorno*

Meanwhile, direct religious invocations in greetings tended to shrink or fade (e.g. *goodbye* < *God be with you*). That’s partly because religion was once baked into every aspect of life, but as societies secularized, the *good* versions stuck around more universally.

---

✅ **So the summary:**

* *good* and *god* are not linguistically related, though they’ve overlapped in culture and sound.
* In greetings, English once had “God” directly (*God be with you*), but it evolved into forms that sound like “good.”
* French *bon* has nothing to do with *Dieu*; it just parallels English “good” because both come from old Indo-European roots meaning “pleasant/beneficial.”

Would you like me to show you a **little timeline of how "God be with you" → "goodbye"** happened? It really illustrates how everyday greetings drift between “good” and “God.”
