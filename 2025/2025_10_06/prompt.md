Just before he passed away recently, a pretty famous musician, Maxi Jazz left a message where he said...
```
Hi there, this is Maxi Jazz from Faithless, and this is what I want you to know about life.
The same life force that created the entirety of the universe is flowing through you, 
meaning that everywhere the universe exists, that's where your life exists.
You are the universe ultimately, and the universe is you.
Now this knowledge requires a fundamental shift in attitude towards praying and prayer.
When you pray you're not asking for help (or at least you shouldn't be), you're telling your universe what you want to see happen in your life.
This works in the exact same way as press ups.
One press up or even a dozen is not going to make you strong.
You have to do it everyday and not give up.
Eventually what you desire, what you want to see happen occurs quite naturally in your life, even though at one time it may have seemed impossible.
So please take it from me, whatever it is your heart desires - whether it be a new guitar, a new job or world peace - please pray hard, and stick at it.
```
Does this make sense to you?
This difference between the two types of praying (telling vs asking)... can you explain more what he might mean by that with some examples?
Do you know anyone else who talks about the theory and practice of prayer in a similar way and who communicates the concepts very well?
