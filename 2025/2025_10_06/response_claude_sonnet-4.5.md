This is a beautiful message that touches on some profound spiritual concepts. Let me break down what Maxi Jazz seems to be getting at:

## The Shift from Asking to Declaring

The distinction he's making is between two fundamentally different mindsets in prayer:

**Traditional "asking" prayer:** "Please God, if it's your will, could you help me get this job?" This assumes you're separate from the creative force, petitioning an external power that may or may not grant your request.

**"Telling/declaring" prayer:** "I am attracting the perfect job into my life" or "I am already aligned with my ideal work." This assumes you're *part of* the creative force of the universe, and you're directing that energy rather than pleading with something outside yourself.

**Examples of the difference:**

- **Asking:** "Please help me be more confident"
- **Telling:** "I am confident and capable in all situations"

- **Asking:** "I hope you'll send me a loving partner"
- **Telling:** "I am ready for and open to a loving relationship"

The "telling" approach is about claiming what you want as if it already exists in potential, then aligning your daily thoughts and actions with that reality until it manifests.

## Similar Thinkers and Teachers

Several people communicate similar ideas very effectively:

**Neville Goddard** (1905-1972) - Perhaps the closest match to Maxi Jazz's philosophy. He taught "living in the end" - imagining your desire already fulfilled and feeling the reality of it. His approach is very practical and he was an incredibly clear communicator.

**Florence Scovel Shinn** - Her book "The Game of Life and How to Play It" (1925) talks about "speaking the word" and affirmative prayer in very accessible, almost playful language.

**Joseph Murphy** - "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind" presents similar ideas about impressing your desires on your subconscious through feeling and repetition, very much like Maxi Jazz's press-ups analogy.

**Ernest Holmes** - Founder of Science of Mind, which teaches "affirmative prayer" or "spiritual mind treatment" - declaring truth rather than begging for it.

The common thread through all of these is the idea that consciousness/mind/spirit is creative, and that we participate in creation through focused intention and feeling, not through pleading with a separate deity. They all emphasize the daily practice aspect that Maxi Jazz mentions - the repetition that reprograms your deeper mind.

Does this resonate with what you were sensing in his message?
