Of course. This is a profound and beautifully articulated message from Maxi Jazz. Let's break down what he's saying.

### Does it make sense?

Yes, it makes a great deal of sense, though it represents a significant departure from traditional, dualistic religious thought. It's a perspective rooted in non-duality, modern spirituality, and certain psychological principles.

Here's a breakdown of the core logic:

1.  **The Premise of Unity:** The foundation of his message is "You are the universe ultimately, and the universe is you." This is a pantheistic or panentheistic viewpoint. Instead of a creator God who is separate from creation (dualism), this view sees the creative force of the universe as being inseparable from everything within it, including ourselves. You aren't a small, separate being *in* the universe; you are a localized expression *of* the universe.
2.  **The Implication for Prayer:** If that premise is true, then praying to an external, separate being is a logical inconsistency. Who are you asking? You would be like a wave in the ocean praying *to* the ocean for help. Maxi Jazz suggests that the act of prayer, in this context, becomes an act of internal alignment and declaration.
3.  **The Shift in Agency:** This shift moves the locus of control from external to internal. You are no longer a powerless supplicant hoping for a favorable response from a distant deity. You are an active co-creator, using your focus and intention to shape the reality you experience.
4.  **The "Press-Ups" Analogy:** This is the most brilliant part of his message because it makes an esoteric concept practical. He's saying that changing your reality through intention isn't a one-time magical wish. It's a discipline. Just as physical muscles grow stronger through consistent resistance training, your ability to manifest your desires (or "tell your universe") grows stronger through consistent, focused, and unwavering intention (prayer/affirmation).

### The Difference Between "Asking" and "Telling" with Examples

This is the core of his functional advice. It's a shift in mindset from lack to creation.

#### Praying as "Asking" (The Traditional Model)

This approach comes from a place of separation and perceived lack. It reinforces the idea that what you desire is *not here* and you need an external power to bring it *to you*.

* **Mindset:** Supplicant, petitioning, hopeful but uncertain.
* **Energy:** It's an appeal from a position of powerlessness. "Please, I don't have this, can you give it to me?"
* **Example 1: Seeking a New Job**
    * **Asking:** "God, please let me get this job. I've been unemployed for so long and I'm desperate. Please make the hiring manager like me."
    * *Analysis:* The focus is on desperation, lack, and the hope that an outside force will intervene and change the circumstances.

* **Example 2: Wanting Better Health**
    * **Asking:** "Please, Universe, heal my body. Take this sickness away from me. I can't bear it anymore."
    * *Analysis:* This prayer reinforces the identity of being "sick" and asks an external force for removal of the unwanted condition.

#### Praying as "Telling" (Maxi Jazz's Model)

This approach comes from a place of unity and creative power. It's an act of declaring an intention and aligning yourself with the reality you wish to experience. You are "telling" your universe—which is you—what pattern to form.

* **Mindset:** Co-creator, declarative, intentional, and persistent.
* **Energy:** It's an act of creation from a position of inner authority. "I am bringing this into my reality."
* **Example 1: Seeking a New Job**
    * **Telling:** "I am aligning myself with the perfect career opportunity that values my skills and provides abundance. I am declaring my intention to attract this role and I am open to the synchronicities that will lead me to it." (This is the daily "press-up").
    * *Analysis:* The focus is on alignment, intention, and an internal state of readiness. It's a statement of what is being created, not what is lacking.

* **Example 2: Wanting Better Health**
    * **Telling:** "I am instructing every cell in my body to align with its natural state of perfect health and vitality. I am the creative force of life, and I am directing that force towards wholeness and well-being within me."
    * *Analysis:* This statement claims authority over one's own physical reality and directs the "life force" towards a desired outcome, rather than begging for the removal of a negative one.

### Others Who Speak on This Theory and Practice

Maxi Jazz's philosophy, while uniquely his, is part of a long tradition of thought. Several thinkers and authors communicate these concepts very well.

1.  **Neville Goddard (1905-1972):** He is perhaps the most direct and eloquent teacher of this specific principle. His core teaching was "assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled." He taught that imagination creates reality and that to manifest something, you must feel yourself into the state of already having it. This is a perfect parallel to "telling your universe." He would say you don't ask for a new guitar; you go to sleep at night feeling the wood of the guitar in your hands and the joy of playing it.
    * **Key Concepts:** "The feeling is the secret," "Living in the end."
    * **Communicates it well?** Extraordinarily. His lectures from the 1950s and 60s are clear, powerful, and filled with practical examples.

2.  **Dr. Joe Dispenza (Contemporary):** A neuroscientist and author, Dispenza provides a modern, scientific framework for Maxi Jazz's "press-ups" analogy. He explains how consistent mental rehearsal (meditation/prayer) literally rewires your brain (creating new neural pathways) and changes your body's chemistry. He teaches that by combining a clear intention with an elevated emotion (like gratitude for something you don't have yet), you can signal new genes and create measurable changes in your life.
    * **Key Concepts:** "Breaking the habit of being yourself," Quantum physics, Neuroplasticity.
    * **Communicates it well?** Yes, he bridges the gap between spirituality and science, which makes the concepts accessible to a modern, skeptical audience.

3.  **The New Thought Movement (Late 19th/Early 20th Century):** This philosophical movement is the intellectual bedrock for many of these ideas. Thinkers like Phineas Quimby, Thomas Troward, and Wallace Wattles (author of *The Science of Getting Rich*) all wrote extensively on the idea that thought is a creative force and that our mental state directly influences our external reality.
    * **Key Concepts:** The Law of Attraction, "Mind is the builder."
    * **Communicates it well?** The language can be a bit dated, but the core principles are laid out with systematic, logical precision.

4.  **Louise Hay (1926-2017):** She popularized a very practical application of "telling" through the use of daily affirmations. Her work focused on healing the body and life by changing thought patterns. An affirmation like "I am healthy, whole, and complete" is a direct example of "telling" your universe what you want to see happen, practiced daily like a press-up.
    * **Key Concepts:** Affirmations, Healing through thought.
    * **Communicates it well?** Incredibly well. Her methods are simple, accessible, and have helped millions.

Maxi Jazz's final message was a beautiful, concise, and empowering distillation of a profound spiritual truth—one that encourages us to see ourselves not as beggars at the door of the universe, but as the universe itself, learning to speak its desires into existence.
