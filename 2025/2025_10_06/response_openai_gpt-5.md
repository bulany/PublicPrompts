That’s a beautiful and thoughtful message from Maxi Jazz — it blends spirituality, psychology, and a kind of energetic worldview.

Let’s unpack what he’s saying and what it might mean in practice.

### 🌌 The Core Idea

Maxi’s message is based on a **non-dual** or **unity** perspective — the idea that *you and the universe (or God, or life force) are not separate*.
So when you pray, you’re not appealing to some external being “out there” to intervene. You’re instead *communicating within your own creative consciousness*, aligning your inner state with what you want to bring into being.

He draws a parallel to **press-ups (push-ups)** — showing that prayer, like training, is not about one dramatic effort but about *consistent practice that gradually reshapes your inner and outer reality*.

### 🙏 Asking vs. Telling Prayer

Here’s the difference as he frames it:

| **Type**                                       | **Focus**                                                             | **Underlying Belief**                                                                 | **Example**                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Asking Prayer**                              | Requesting something from a higher power                              | “I am separate from the source. I need help from outside.”                            | “Please, God, help me find a job.”                                      |
| **Telling Prayer** (or **Affirmative Prayer**) | Declaring what you wish to *manifest* as already possible or underway | “The universe and I are one; by aligning my thoughts and emotions, I help it unfold.” | “I am ready for fulfilling work, and opportunities are opening for me.” |

So rather than *asking for rain*, you might *affirm and feel gratitude as though the rain were already falling*.
This isn’t wishful thinking — it’s training your consciousness to dwell in the **state of realization**, not the **state of lack**.

### 💪 The Practice — Like Push-Ups

The analogy to push-ups is brilliant because it shifts “prayer” from a single emotional plea into a **discipline of inner alignment**.

Examples:

* You want confidence? Each day you *speak and feel* confident thoughts (“I move through the world calmly and clearly”).
* You want peace? You *practice peace* daily — noticing agitation, breathing, choosing calm again and again.
* You want creativity? You *affirm yourself as creative* and keep showing up to create — until that becomes your natural state.

Over time, the repetition rewires your mindset and your behavior, and your external world begins to reflect that change.

### 🧘‍♂️ Others Who Teach Similar Ideas

Several teachers and thinkers talk about prayer and creation in almost the same spirit — though from different traditions:

* **Neville Goddard** — taught that “prayer is the feeling of the wish fulfilled.” He emphasized imagination as the divine creative power in each person.
* **Wayne Dyer** — often said that you must “assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled” and align with intention rather than need.
* **Ernest Holmes** (founder of *Science of Mind*) — developed “affirmative prayer,” which is about recognizing oneness with the divine and speaking from that unity.
* **Paramahansa Yogananda** — described prayer as *communion* with the divine presence within, not petition to an external deity.
* **Deepak Chopra** — connects quantum ideas and consciousness, emphasizing that attention and intention shape reality.
* **Joseph Murphy** — in *The Power of Your Subconscious Mind*, he writes that prayer works when you impress the subconscious mind with conviction rather than desperation.
* **Florence Scovel Shinn** — early 20th-century teacher who said, “Your word is your wand,” meaning that what you affirm with faith shapes your experience.

### 🌱 In Short

Maxi Jazz is pointing to **a shift from supplication to co-creation**.
Prayer becomes a *conversation within yourself as part of the universe*, not a request to a remote authority.
It’s both mystical and practical: you train your inner world daily until your outer world matches it.

Would you like me to show what a few *daily “telling” style prayers or affirmations* might look like in the spirit of what Maxi Jazz described (e.g., for peace, creativity, or purpose)?
