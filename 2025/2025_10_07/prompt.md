I just found out that someone with the last name 'Villain' assasinated 'Jaures'.
Who was Jaures and can you give me a short biography of him?
Who was 'Villain'? Can you do the same for him?
Is it just an amazing coincidence that his last name is 'Villain', or is this actually where the French word and its meaning came from?
Did it transfer from there to English?
