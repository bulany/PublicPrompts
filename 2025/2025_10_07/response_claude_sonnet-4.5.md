I'll search for information about this assassination to give you accurate details.Let me get more detailed information about both men.Now let me search for information about the etymology of the word "villain" to answer your question about whether this is where the word came from.Excellent question! This is indeed a remarkable coincidence, but the surname "Villain" and the English word "villain" actually have the **same ancient origin** - they don't come from Raoul Villain himself.

## Jean Jaurès (1859-1914)

Jean Jaurès was a French socialist leader who began as a Moderate Republican before becoming a social democrat and one of the first possibilists (the reformist wing of the socialist movement). Born on September 3, 1859, in Castres, Tarn, into a modest provincial family, he was a brilliant student who was admitted first at the École normale supérieure in philosophy in 1878, ahead of Henri Bergson.

In 1904, he founded the socialist newspaper L'Humanité. Jaurès was a committed antimilitarist who tried to use diplomatic means to prevent what became the First World War. On July 31, 1914, at 9 pm, he went to dine at the Café du Croissant on Rue Montmartre, and forty minutes later, Raoul Villain, a 29-year-old French nationalist, walked up to the restaurant window and fired two shots into Jaurès's back, killing him five minutes later.

## Raoul Villain (1885-1936)

Raoul Villain was a French nationalist born on September 19, 1885, who is primarily remembered for his assassination of Jean Jaurès on July 31, 1914, in Paris. Villain was acquitted by a jury of peers in 1919 and later fled to Spain, where he was killed by Republicans during the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

## About the Name "Villain"

This is a **complete coincidence**! The word "villain" originated around 1300 from Anglo-French vilain, meaning "peasant" or "farmhand," derived from Late Latin vīllānus, meaning serf or peasant, someone who was bound to the soil of a Latin vīlla. The word simply meant a farm worker or commoner and only later took on its negative connotation.

So the surname "Villain" was already an established French family name (like "Farmer" or "Miller" in English) centuries before Raoul Villain was born. The English word "villain" came from the same Old French word "vilain" in the Middle Ages, meaning it transferred from French to English many centuries earlier. The fact that someone named Villain committed such a villainous act is purely ironic coincidence!
