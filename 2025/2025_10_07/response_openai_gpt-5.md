Yes — that’s quite a striking coincidence! Let’s unpack it carefully:

---

### **Jean Jaurès (1859–1914)**

Jean Jaurès was a major French **socialist leader, intellectual, and orator** in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

* **Early life:** Born in Castres (southern France) to a modest family, Jaurès studied philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure and became a professor.
* **Political career:** He began as a moderate republican but gradually became a socialist, advocating for workers’ rights, social justice, and peace.
* **Legacy:** He founded the newspaper *L’Humanité*, which became a central organ of the French left. He was instrumental in uniting various socialist factions into what became the French Socialist Party (SFIO).
* **Assassination:** On **31 July 1914**, just days before World War I began, Jaurès was assassinated in Paris by a nationalist named **Raoul Villain**, who opposed Jaurès’ strong pacifism and efforts to prevent war.
  Jaurès’ death symbolized the collapse of the international socialist peace movement on the eve of the war.

### **Raoul Villain (1885–1936)**

Raoul Villain was a **French nationalist**, born in Reims.

* He studied art and archaeology but was heavily influenced by nationalist and anti-pacifist circles.
* Believing Jaurès was a traitor for opposing France’s entry into World War I, he shot him through the window of a café in Paris.
* **Trial and aftermath:** Astonishingly, after the war, Villain was **acquitted** in 1919 — a verdict that outraged many on the left.
* Later, Villain moved to Spain, where he was killed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, likely by Republican forces who mistook or targeted him as a spy.

### **About the name “Villain”**

The resemblance between his name and the English/French word *vilain/villain* (meaning “bad person”) is indeed fascinating — but **pure coincidence**.

Here’s why:

* The word *vilain* in **Old French** originally meant *peasant* or *farm laborer*, from Latin *villanus* = “farmhand, person attached to a villa (estate)”.
* Over time, nobles used it disparagingly, and by the Middle Ages it had come to mean “low-born, base, morally corrupt” — the source of our English “villain.”
* So the negative meaning of *vilain* long **predated Raoul Villain’s birth by centuries**.

Therefore, Raoul Villain’s last name shares the same spelling as the modern French word, but it’s **etymologically older** and unrelated to his personal character or the modern meaning.

### **In short**

* Jaurès: socialist pacifist leader, assassinated 1914.
* Villain: nationalist assassin, later killed in Spain.
* The shared name is a **coincidence** — the word *villain* (in English and French) already meant “bad person” hundreds of years earlier.

Would you like me to show how *villain/vilain*’s meaning shifted through different centuries in French and English? It’s quite a neat linguistic timeline.
