I have a series of 30 hand-drawn images on seperate pages of a notebook.
Each image has been drawn on top of a "grid" which is just a series of 16 pencil marks forming 9 squares.
The drawn images don't take up all the room so on every image there are at least some of the grid points still visible.
I want to some how capture each of these images (with my phone camera) and stitch them together to make some kind of animation (video) that I can share on instagram.
What is the most efficient and least tedious way you can think of to achieve this. I'm happy to use software but I think I only really want to use open source command line tools (on my M1 mac).
