Of course. The most efficient way to do this uses a combination of two powerful command-line tools: **Hugin's `align_image_stack`** for automatically aligning the images using your grid points and **FFmpeg** to compile them into a video.

This method avoids any manual cropping or positioning, letting the software do the tedious work for you. The visible grid points are the keyâ€”they'll act as control points for perfect alignment.

### Step 1: Capture & Transfer

1.  **Photograph Your Images**: Take a photo of each of the 30 drawings. Try to be reasonably consistent with your framing and lighting, but don't worry about perfectionâ€”the alignment tool will fix small shifts and rotations.
2.  **Transfer to Your Mac**: Use AirDrop to send all the images to a new folder on your Mac.
3.  **Rename the Files Sequentially**: This is a **critical step**. The files need to be in a numbered sequence for the video conversion to work correctly. Open the folder, select all the images, right-click, and choose "Rename". Select "Format" from the dropdown, and set it up to name your files something like `frame_001.jpg`, `frame_002.jpg`, etc. Make sure the numbering has leading zeros (e.g., `01`, `02`...`30` or `001`, `002`...`030`).

### Step 2: Install the Tools

You'll need Homebrew, the package manager for macOS. If you don't have it, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install `hugin-tools` (which contains `align_image_stack`) and `ffmpeg`.

```bash
brew install hugin-tools ffmpeg
```

### Step 3: Align the Image Stack

Now for the magic part. ðŸª„ Navigate to your folder of images in the Terminal. The `align_image_stack` tool will find the matching grid points in each image and warp them so they all line up perfectly.

Run the following command in your image folder:

```bash
align_image_stack -a aligned_ -c 16 --use-given-order *.jpg
```

**Let's break that down:**

  * `align_image_stack`: The command itself.
  * `-a aligned_`: This sets the **prefix** for the new, aligned output files. You'll get files named `aligned_0000.tif`, `aligned_0001.tif`, etc.
  * `-c 16`: This tells the tool to find **16 control points** per image pair. Since you have a 4x4 grid of 16 pencil marks, this is the perfect number.
  * `--use-given-order`: This ensures the output files stay in the same alpha-numeric order as your input files, which is essential for the animation.
  * `*.jpg`: This is a wildcard that selects all JPEG files in the current folder as input.

This process will create a new set of `.tif` files in your folder. These are your perfectly stabilized frames.

### Step 4: Create the Video with FFmpeg

Once you have your `aligned_*.tif` files, you can stitch them into a video using FFmpeg. This command is optimized for quality and Instagram compatibility.

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 8 -i aligned_%04d.tif -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 animation.mp4
```

**Let's break that down:**

  * `ffmpeg`: The command to run the FFmpeg program.
  * `-framerate 8`: This sets the **frames per second (fps)**. For a hand-drawn animation, a lower value like 8 or 10 often looks best. A 30-image animation at 8 fps will result in a 3.75-second video. Adjust this number to change the speed.
  * `-i aligned_%04d.tif`: This tells FFmpeg what the **input files** are. The `%04d` part is a pattern that matches any four-digit number (like `0000`, `0001`, etc.), which corresponds to the files created by `align_image_stack`.
  * `-c:v libx264`: Specifies the video **codec** (H.264), which is the standard for web video.
  * `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Sets the **pixel format** for maximum compatibility across devices and platforms like Instagram.
  * `-crf 18`: This is the **quality** setting. `18` is nearly lossless. You can increase it to `23` for a smaller file size with very little noticeable difference.
  * `animation.mp4`: The name of your **output video file**.

After running this, you'll have a high-quality `animation.mp4` file in your folder, ready to be AirDropped back to your phone and shared\! ðŸš€

### Optional: Cropping

The alignment process might leave some black or transparent edges on your video where the images were rotated or shifted. You can use FFmpeg to crop this out. First, play the `animation.mp4` file to figure out the right crop dimensions. Then, run a command like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i animation.mp4 -vf "crop=1080:1080:X:Y" final_animation.mp4
```

Replace `1080:1080` with your desired output width and height (e.g., a square for Instagram) and `X:Y` with the top-left coordinate to start the crop from.
