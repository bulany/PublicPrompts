Of course\! This is a fantastic idea, and a very common scenario in open-source development. Building a more focused, user-friendly library on top of a more general-purpose one is a great way to contribute.

The best practice is to **create a new, dedicated project**, not a long-term fork, while providing clear and prominent attribution to the original work. You'll package your core player and the soundfonts as separate, **scoped npm packages** for maximum flexibility.

-----

## Forking, Attribution, and Licensing

This is the most important part to get right. You want to be a good open-source citizen. ü§ù

  * **Fork vs. New Repo:** Start by **forking** Sergey Surikov's project on GitHub. This gives you an initial copy to work with. However, because your goal is to create a new library with a different structure and API (not to contribute changes back to the original `webaudiofont`), you should immediately create a **new, separate repository** for your project. You'll move the code you need from your fork into this new repo.

  * **Giving Credit:** This is non-negotiable. The goal is to make it obvious to anyone who uses your project where the core technology came from.

    1.  **LICENSE File:** `webaudiofont` uses the **MIT License**. This is a very permissive license, but its one major condition is that you must include the original copyright and permission notice in your software. So, you **must** copy his `LICENSE` file into your project. You can add your own copyright notice to the file for the modifications and new work you've done.
    2.  **README.md:** In your project's `README.md` file, have a prominent "Credits" or "Acknowledgements" section at the top. It should clearly state that your project is built upon the excellent work of Sergey Surikov's `webaudiofont` and link directly to his GitHub repository.
    3.  **Source Code:** It's also good practice to include a comment at the top of the key source files you've adapted, mentioning their origin.

By doing this, you are respecting the original author's work while being clear that your project is a separate entity with a different goal.

## Packaging Strategy: Scoped Packages

The best way to handle your core player and multiple instruments is with **scoped npm packages**. A scoped package looks like `@your-npm-username/package-name`. This prevents name clashes on npm and groups all your related packages under a personal or organizational namespace.

Here's the recommended structure:

1.  **The Core Player (`@your-name/player`):**

      * This package contains the main logic. It would have your simplified API (`loadSound`, `playNotes`) and would depend on `tone.js`.
      * It would *not* contain any audio samples itself.
      * Example name: `@js-music/sampler`

2.  **The Instrument Soundfonts (`@your-name/soundfont-piano`):**

      * Each instrument is its own tiny package.
      * It contains only the necessary sound files (e.g., the base64 encoded piano samples from `webaudiofont`).
      * It exposes the sound data in a predictable way.
      * Example names: `@js-music/soundfont-piano`, `@js-music/soundfont-acoustic-guitar`

This approach is perfect. Users only install the instruments they need, keeping their `node_modules` folder and final app bundle small.

**User Installation would look exactly like you imagined:**

```bash
# Install the player and the piano soundfont
npm install @your-name/player @your-name/soundfont-piano
```

## Step-by-Step Guide: From GitHub to NPM Release üöÄ

Here‚Äôs a practical walkthrough to get you from code to a published package.

### Step 1: Project Setup

1.  **Create a Monorepo (Optional but Recommended):** For managing multiple packages (the player and various soundfonts), a monorepo is ideal. You can use tools like **pnpm**, **npm workspaces**, or **Turborepo** to manage this. For simplicity, we'll start with just one package.

2.  **Initialize Your Player Package:**

    ```bash
    mkdir my-sampler-project && cd my-sampler-project
    npm init -y
    ```

    This creates a `package.json` file.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Runtime dependencies
    npm install tone

    # Development dependencies for a TypeScript project
    npm install -D typescript rollup @rollup/plugin-typescript
    ```

    *(**Rollup** is a great, lightweight bundler for creating libraries).*

### Step 2: Write and Organize Your Code

Structure your project logically.

```
my-sampler-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts      # Your main player logic (e.g., the SamplePlayer class)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json      # Project configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rollup.config.js  # Bundler configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE           # Copied from the original webaudiofont project
```

### Step 3: Configure `package.json` for Publishing

This file is the "ID card" for your npm package. It's critical.

```json
{
  "name": "@your-npm-username/player", // Use a scoped name!
  "version": "0.1.0", // Start with a pre-release version
  "description": "A simple, offline-first MIDI sample player for the web.",
  "main": "dist/index.js", // Entry point for CommonJS (Node)
  "module": "dist/index.mjs", // Entry point for ES Modules (browsers)
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts", // TypeScript type definitions
  "files": [
    "dist" // Only publish the 'dist' folder
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c", // A script to build your distributable files
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run build" // Automatically build before publishing
  },
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "tone": "^14.7.77"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... your dev dependencies
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Build Your Code

Your `rollup.config.js` will tell Rollup how to take your TypeScript source code from `src/` and bundle it into JavaScript files in a `dist/` directory. When a user installs your package, they will only get the code in `dist/`.

### Step 5: Document in `README.md`

Your `README.md` is your most important piece of documentation. Include:

  * A short, clear description.
  * The **Credits** section linking to `webaudiofont`.
  * **Installation** instructions.
  * A simple **"Getting Started"** code example.

### Step 6: Publish to NPM

1.  **Create an NPM Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).
2.  **Login via CLI:** Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm login
    ```
    Follow the prompts.
3.  **Publish\!** From your project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm publish --access public
    ```
    The `--access public` flag is **required** the first time you publish a scoped package on a free npm plan.

That's it\! Your package is now live. To update it, you just need to change the `version` number in `package.json` (e.g., to `0.1.1`) and run `npm publish` again.

## The Ideal User Workflow

Your vision for the user workflow is spot on. Here‚Äôs how it would look with the scoped package strategy.

1.  **A user starts a new project:**

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-music-app -- --template vue-ts
    cd my-music-app
    ```

2.  **They install your library:**

    ```bash
    npm install @your-name/player @your-name/soundfont-piano
    ```

3.  **They start coding in their Vue component:**

    ```typescript
    import { SamplePlayer } from '@your-name/player';
    import { piano } from '@your-name/soundfont-piano';

    // Your player's constructor would register the soundfont
    const player = new SamplePlayer();
    player.loadSound({ name: 'piano', data: piano });

    // The API you wanted
    function playMusic() {
      player.playNotes([
        { time: 0, pitch: 69, duration: 0.3, velocity: 0.8 },
        { time: 1, pitch: 81, duration: 0.3, velocity: 0.8 }
      ]);
    }
    ```

This is clean, modular, and extremely easy for a new user to understand. Good luck with the project\! üéπ
