Nice project — great design goal (small, installable piano package + tiny player wrapper). Below I’ll walk you through **(A)** the licensing reality you must face with surikov’s work, then **(B)** practical packaging & repo strategies (fork vs wrapper vs monorepo), and finally **(C)** a concrete, copy-paste-able step-by-step from GitHub → npm (with example `package.json` snippets + usage). I’ll also give naming/packaging recommendations so people can `npm install` a tiny piano quickly.

---

# A — Licensing: the important first fact

* **WebAudioFont (surikov/webaudiofont) is distributed under GPL-3.0** (the project page shows GPL-3.0). ([GitHub][1]).
* GPL-3.0 is a strong *copyleft* license: if you distribute a derivative work that includes GPLed code, you generally must release it under the GPL as well (and make source available). See the GNU FAQ for details. ([GNU][2]).

Implication: **if your npm package includes or is a derivative of WebAudioFont code**, your package will need to comply with GPL (and that often means your code must be GPL if it’s a derivative). If you just *call* a separate GPL binary at runtime or *link* to it, the legal boundary can be fuzzy for JS packages — treat it as “risky” unless you keep everything clearly separate or get permission. See discussions about GPL + JS modules. ([Open Source Stack Exchange][3]).

Also note: the instrument/sample data in WebAudioFont come from various SF2 soundfonts (GeneralUserGS, FluidR3 etc.); each sample set/file can have its own license/attribution requirements — check `webaudiofontdata` and per-file headers for specifics. The main project README points to those soundfont sources. ([GitHub][1]).

**My recommendation about license:** decide early whether you want to ship under GPL (ok, but be explicit and include the GPL license file and source) **or** avoid bundling GPL code and instrument files such that you can use a permissive license (MIT) for your wrapper. If you want a permissive license but need parts of WebAudioFont, contact the author (the repo says “contact me if you need different license”). ([GitHub][1]). I’m not a lawyer — if this matters for a company product, consult legal counsel.

# B — Packaging & release strategies (practical options)

### Option 1 — **Fork and publish a GPL package**

* Fork `webaudiofont`, strip/reorganize, keep `LICENSE.md` (GPL) and attribution, and publish your curated package to npm. Works fine — but your published package will be GPL and you must distribute source and license.
* Pros: fastest, reuse full player + sample loader, little re-implementation.
* Cons: GPL forces copyleft; some consumers avoid GPL packages.

When to choose: you’re comfortable releasing under GPL and want the least rewrite.

### Option 2 — **Make a small permissive-licensed wrapper + separate instrument packages**

* Create a **core** player/wrapper package (e.g. `@your-scope/midi-sample-player`) that you license permissively (MIT). This package **does not include** any GPL code. It provides the tiny API you want (e.g. `loadSound()` / `playNotes()`), uses Tone.js for scheduling (your choice), and *optionally* uses WebAudio API directly.
* Publish **instrument packages** separately (one package per instrument) — *only* include samples you have the rights to ship. Example packages:

  * `@your-scope/midi-sample-piano` (small piano sample, included in `node_modules` so it works offline)
  * `@your-scope/midi-sample-strings` (another instrument)
* The core player can accept different backends:

  * fallback to `webaudiofont` **only** if the consumer explicitly installs it (and the consumer accepts GPL); or
  * use your own tiny wavetable loader for the small piano (so no GPL involvement).
* Pros: modular, small installs, consumers can only install what they need (e.g. just piano).
* Cons: more initial work (you need to implement minimal player or get clean instrument licenses).

**This is the approach I recommend** if you want permissive licensing and small installs: put each instrument in its own npm package and make the player depend on them via normal `dependencies` or let the user decide which instruments to install.

### Option 3 — **Monorepo with npm workspaces**

* Put core player + instrument packages in one GitHub repo using npm workspaces (or pnpm). This allows easy local development and controlled publishing of each package.
* Root `package.json` (private) lists `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`.
* Pros: tidy dev workflow, single repo to manage many instrument packages. You publish each package separately (or automate publishing for each package).
* Good docs: npm workspaces guides. ([geekyants.com][4]).

# C — Concrete step-by-step (GitHub → npm), with examples

Below I’ll assume you choose **Option 2 + monorepo** (recommended). I’ll show the repo layout, key `package.json`s, publish steps, and consumer install usage.

## 1) Repo layout (monorepo)

```
midi-sample-monorepo/            # git repo
├─ package.json                  # root (private) with workspaces
├─ packages/
│  ├─ player/                    # @your-scope/midi-sample-player
│  │  ├─ package.json
│  │  ├─ src/
│  │  └─ dist/
│  └─ piano/                     # @your-scope/midi-sample-piano
│     ├─ package.json
│     ├─ index.js                # small wrapper that exports the sample data
│     └─ sound/_tone_piano.js    # the sample data (or small wav)
```

Root `package.json` (private, workspaces):

```json
{
  "name": "midi-sample-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

## 2) Example `package.json` for the **player** package

(keeps player small, depends on `tone` and optionally expects instrument packages)

```json
{
  "name": "@your-scope/midi-sample-player",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": ["dist"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "tone": "^14.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

* `peerDependencies` for `tone` means the app installing the player will supply `tone` (no duplication).
* If you **do** choose to depend on `webaudiofont`, consider doing as a `peerDependency` and **document** the GPL implications clearly.

## 3) Example `package.json` for the **piano** package

(contains only the small piano sample files / JS data and an index that exports the instrument)

```json
{
  "name": "@your-scope/midi-sample-piano",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "files": ["index.js", "sound/"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["webaudio", "soundfont", "piano", "midi"]
}
```

`index.js` can simply export the instrument data object (the same shape your player expects):

```js
// index.js
import piano from './sound/_tone_piano.js';
export default piano;
export const name = 'piano';
```

If the sample asset is a JS file already compatible with WebAudioFont player (e.g. `_tone_0250_*.js`), you can repackage only the small piano-file; include instrument license/attribution in the package.

**Important**: Put a `LICENSE` file that mirrors the instrument data license (if that data requires CC/BY or other) inside the instrument package. Check each sound file’s header for license info. ([Surikov GitHub Pages][5]).

## 4) Player API (example)

In `@your-scope/midi-sample-player` implement an API like:

```ts
// pseudocode TypeScript
export class SamplePlayer {
  constructor(audioContext: AudioContext) { ... }
  async loadSound(name: string, moduleOrPath: any) { /* accepts imported package default */ }
  playNotes(notes: Array<{start_time:number,end_time:number,pitch:number,velocity:number}>) { ... }
}
```

Usage in a Vue/TS project (consumer):

```ts
import { SamplePlayer } from '@your-scope/midi-sample-player';
import piano from '@your-scope/midi-sample-piano';

const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const player = new SamplePlayer(audioContext);

await player.loadSound('piano', piano);
player.playNotes([
  { start_time: 1.2, end_time: 1.5, pitch: 69, velocity: 80 },
  { start_time: 2.2, end_time: 2.5, pitch: 81, velocity: 80 }
]);
```

This keeps installs small: users `npm i @your-scope/midi-sample-player @your-scope/midi-sample-piano` and they're done.

## 5) Publish to npm (manual)

1. Create npm account if you haven’t: `npm adduser` / `npm login`.
2. In each package directory, make sure `package.json` `name` is unique (use a scope for clarity: `@your-scope/...`). Scoped public packages must be published with `--access public`. See the npm docs on scoped packages. ([docs.npmjs.com][6])
3. Build the package (e.g. `npm run build` → create `dist/`).
4. Publish: from package dir `npm publish --access public` (if scoped). For unscoped just `npm publish`.
5. For monorepo: you can `npm publish` each package from its `packages/<pkg>` directory or automate it with GitHub Actions. (Use `npm version` to bump and tag; `npm publish` publishes the current version.)

Docs / naming rules: check the npm package name guidelines and the scoped package docs. ([docs.npmjs.com][7])

## 6) Automating publish (recommended)

* Use GitHub Actions to publish on tag/release. Many examples and actions exist that will `npm publish` with credentials stored in `secrets.NPM_TOKEN`. (Automating avoids manual `npm login` on CI.)

## 7) Files & static asset best practices

* Use the `files` array in `package.json` to control what gets published (avoid shipping tests / big sources). Use `.npmignore` if needed. Best practice: build to `dist/` and publish only `dist/` and your instrument assets. ([Mik Bry][8]).
* For large sample sets consider:

  * **Small option (packaged):** ship one tiny instrument per package (good for quick start / offline).
  * **Large option (CDN or optional dep):** host the big libraries on a CDN / GitHub releases and lazy-load them (the consumer downloads on first use). Provide both options.

---

# D — Naming recommendations

* Use a scope: `@your-scope/midi-sample-player` and `@your-scope/midi-sample-piano`. Scopes group packages and avoid global name collisions. (See scoped package docs.) ([docs.npmjs.com][6])
* Keep names short & descriptive, no uppercase, avoid trademarks (don’t use “webaudiofont” in your package name unless you have a relationship/permission). See npm package name guidelines. ([docs.npmjs.com][7])
* Alternatives: `@your-scope/simple-piano`, `@your-scope/midi-samples/piano` (you can use nested names but simpler is better).

---

# E — Example “quick start” for consumers

If you publish the packages as above, ideal consumer flow:

```bash
npm init vite@latest my-app -- --template vue
cd my-app
npm i @your-scope/midi-sample-player @your-scope/midi-sample-piano tone
# or if player bundles tone, then only player + piano
```

Then in app code use the `SamplePlayer` API (example earlier).

---

# F — Practical checklist & next actions for you

1. Decide license target: GPL (keep webaudiofont code) **or** permissive (re-implement/avoid bundling GPL). If permissive and you want surikov’s code, **ask him** whether a relicense/permission is possible (the repo invites contact). ([GitHub][1])
2. Choose repo layout: monorepo + npm workspaces (recommended). ([geekyants.com][4])
3. Implement core API and one tiny piano package (include sample and license header). Test in a small Vite Vue project.
4. Publish packages individually; document clearly that some instruments may have different licenses and provide attribution.
5. Optionally add GitHub Actions to publish on tag.

If you want, I can **generate a starter monorepo skeleton** right now (folder tree, `package.json` files for root/player/piano, a minimal `SamplePlayer` stub in TypeScript, and a tiny example Vue usage file). Tell me whether you want the starter to (A) **include** WebAudioFont files (and thus be GPL), or (B) **avoid** including WebAudioFont (permissive). I’ll produce the template accordingly.
