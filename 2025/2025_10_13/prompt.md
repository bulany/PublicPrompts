What is so special about Minnie Riperton's song 'Les fleurs'?
What do the lyrics speak of?
They are mostly in english right?
Did Minnie have any connection to France? Why do you think she chose to title the song in French?
It seems a little strange?
I heard that Minnie was only 22 when she released this song... could you give me a short biography of her and maybe put this song and its release into the broader context of her life and career?
Have lots of people sampled Les Fleurs? What are some of the more famous and well known uses of it?
