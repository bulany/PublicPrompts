**Les Fleurs**

Song by Minnie Riperton

> Will somebody wear me to the fair?
> (To the morning, sings the lovely flower)
> Will a lady pin me in her hair?
> (Mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh)
> Will a child find me by a stream?
> (Gaily laughing in a sundream shower)
> Ooh, kiss my petals, weave me through a dream
> 
> For all of these simple things and much more
> A flower was born
> It blooms to spread love and joy, faith and hope
> To people forlorn
> Inside every man, lives the seed of a flower
> If he looks within, he finds beauty and power
> 
> Ring all the bells, sing and tell the people
> Everywhere that the flower has come
> Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness
> And rejoice for the darkness is gone
> Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely
> At the sign that a new time is born
> ...
