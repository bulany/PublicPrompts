I found it. Let me search for more information about Jean Cocteau's "Ispahan" story.Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about the story. Let me provide you with a detailed answer.

Based on my search, you're thinking of a story that features **Ispahan** (Isfahan), but it's not titled "Le Prince Pesan." The story you heard is likely **"Death and the Gardener"** (or in French, variations like "Le Jardinier et la Mort" or simply the passage from Jean Cocteau's novel).

## The Story

The tale involves a young Persian gardener who tells his prince that he met Death in the morning and Death made a threatening gesture at him. The frightened gardener asks to borrow horses to flee to Ispahan (Isfahan) by that evening. The prince lends him the horses. Later that afternoon, the prince encounters Death and asks why Death threatened his gardener. Death replies that it wasn't a threatening gesture but one of surprise—Death was surprised to see the gardener there that morning, since Death had an appointment to take him in Ispahan that same evening.

## Origin and Timeline

The ultimate written source is almost certainly the Babylonian Talmud (Sukkah 53a), dating back to ancient times, though the original involved the Angel of Death and two Cushites who served King Solomon, set in different locations.

The story is thought to have its origin in The Mathnawi by Rumi (Jalal ad-Din Muhammad ar-Rumi), the 13th-century Sufi poet.

Jean Cocteau brought the story to Western Europe through his 1923 novel "Le Grand Écart" (The Grand Écart), where it appears in Chapter 2. This story by Jean Cocteau is allegedly the shortest bona fide complete horror story ever written.

W. Somerset Maugham later adapted Cocteau's telling in his 1933 play "Sheppey," which was a padded and altered expansion of Cocteau's version. John O'Hara also used a version as the epigraph for his novel "Appointment in Samarra" (1934).

## English Versions

Yes, there are multiple English translations available. The story has been translated from Cocteau's French version numerous times, and it also appears in English through Maugham's play and various poetry translations.

## Popularity Through Time

The tale has evolved considerably:
- **Ancient times**: Existed in Middle Eastern oral tradition and religious texts
- **13th century**: Appeared in Rumi's Mathnawi
- **1923**: Cocteau's French literary version
- **1930s**: Spread through Maugham and O'Hara to English-speaking audiences
- **Modern era**: Widely recognized as a classic parable about fate and the futility of trying to escape destiny

The story remains popular today as a philosophical meditation on fate, destiny, and the impossibility of escaping one's appointed end.
