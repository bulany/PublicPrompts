It appears there may be a slight misunderstanding of the title and place name. The story you are referring to is almost certainly **"Le Petit Prince,"** known in English as **"The Little Prince,"** one of the most famous and beloved works of French literature. There is no widely known French story titled "Le Prince Pesan," and the city of "Isaphar" does not feature in "Le Petit Prince." It is possible that "Isaphar" is a misremembered name of one of the planets the Little Prince visits.

Here is a detailed answer to your questions about this cherished story.

### The Story of "Le Petit Prince"

"The Little Prince" is a poetic and philosophical tale written and illustrated by the French aristocrat, writer, and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

The story begins with the narrator, a pilot, who has crashed his plane in the vast Sahara Desert. As he tries to repair his aircraft, he is unexpectedly greeted by a small boy with golden hair, the Little Prince. The Prince asks the narrator to draw him a sheep.

The narrator learns that the Little Prince comes from a tiny asteroid, B-612, which has three volcanoes (two active and one dormant) and a single, beautiful, and vain rose. The Prince loves his rose deeply but becomes heartbroken by her demanding nature. This prompts him to leave his small planet and journey across the universe to understand the world and find true friendship.

During his travels, the Little Prince visits several other small planets, each inhabited by a single, narrow-minded adult. These encounters serve as allegories for the follies of grown-up life:
* **The King:** Who believes he reigns over everything but has no subjects.
* **The Vain Man:** Who desires only admiration.
* **The Drunkard:** Who drinks to forget that he is ashamed of drinking.
* **The Businessman:** Who endlessly counts the stars, believing he owns them.
* **The Lamplighter:** Who follows a rigid, nonsensical routine of lighting and extinguishing a lamp on a planet where a day lasts only a minute.
* **The Geographer:** Who has never explored the world he maps.

Finally, the Little Prince arrives on Earth, where he is initially struck by its vastness and the loneliness he feels. He encounters a snake who speaks in riddles and a garden full of roses, which makes him realize his own rose is not as unique as he once thought.

His most profound encounter is with a wise fox, who teaches him the meaning of friendship and love through the concept of "taming." The fox explains that to be "tamed" is to establish ties with another, making them unique and special to you. This lesson helps the Prince understand his deep connection to his rose.

Ultimately, the Little Prince decides to return to his asteroid and his rose. To do so, he allows the venomous snake he first met to bite him, believing this is the only way to shed his physical body and travel back to his home among the stars. The story ends with the pilot, having repaired his plane, reflecting on his time with the Little Prince and looking at the stars with a newfound sense of wonder and loss.

### Popularity and Notoriety Through Time

"Le Petit Prince" was not an immediate bestseller. Its philosophical nature and melancholic tone made it difficult for critics to categorize as either a children's book or an adult novella.

However, in the decades following its publication, its popularity grew exponentially. Readers of all ages were drawn to its timeless themes of love, loss, friendship, and the absurdity of adult life. The book's gentle critique of the "grown-up" world and its celebration of childlike wonder resonated with a global audience.

By the late 20th century, "Le Petit Prince" had become a cultural phenomenon. It has been translated into over 300 languages and dialects, making it one of the most translated books in history. It has sold over 200 million copies worldwide and continues to sell millions each year.

The story has been adapted into numerous films, plays, ballets, and an opera. Its iconic illustrations, drawn by Saint-Exupéry himself, are instantly recognizable around the world. Today, "Le Petit Prince" is considered a classic of world literature, cherished for its profound and heartwarming message about what is truly important in life: the matters of the heart that are "invisible to the eye."
