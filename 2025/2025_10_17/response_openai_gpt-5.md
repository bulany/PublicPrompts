I wasn’t able to find anything credible about a story called *“Le Prince Pesan”* or a city “Isaphar” (or similar spellings) in French or other sources. It doesn’t seem to match any well-documented folktale, myth, or literary work in the major databases I checked. Here’s a breakdown of what I discovered, what might be going on, and suggestions for further investigation. If you like, I can try digging further or help you check in local/oral sources.

## What *could* this “Le Prince Pesan” be, based on what I found

Since there is no direct match, there are several possibilities:

1. **Mis-hearing / variant name**
   It’s possible that “Pesan” is a corruption or mis-remembering of some other name (e.g. Persian, Arabic, or Indian origin) and similarly “Isaphar” might be something else (e.g. “Isfahan”, “Sipar”, “Ispahan”, “Shāh-pur”, etc.).

2. **Local/oral version**
   The tale might be a localized variant or of oral tradition, not widely published. Sometimes stories are retold in certain regions under different names that don’t show up in broader written corpuses.

3. **Literary/modern creation**
   It could be a modern story (book, radio, theatre) rather than old folklore — perhaps not yet documented widely.

## Comparable stories / existing similar tales

While I didn’t find “Le Prince Pesan”, there are several stories somewhat in the ballpark, which might have been conflated or mis-remembered; here are some:

* *Le Prince Prédestiné* (“The Predestined Prince”) — an ancient Egyptian tale from the Papyrus Harris No. 500. It tells of a prince who is subject to three fates (crocodile, serpent, dog), and how events unfold with those destinies. ([fr.wikisource.org][1])
* The “three sisters / jealous sisters” motif, princes exiled, etc., appear in many folktales (e.g. *L’Augel Belverde* (“Lancelot, roi de Provins”) from Straparola, the *Tsar Saltan* by Pushkin). ([Wikipedia][2])
* Arabic / “Oriental” style tales in *Les Mille et Une Nuits*, some of which were added by Galland and others. These often have princes, magical cities, far-off lands. Eg, “Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Pari Banou.” ([Wikipedia][3])

## What I can say about origin & timeline (tentative)

Given that I did **not** find “Le Prince Pesan” in known anthologies, what I can say is:

* If it is related to ancient Egyptian tales (e.g. *Le Prince Prédestiné*), then similar themes date back to the 2nd millennium BCE. Such tales were written down during the New Kingdom / later dynastic periods. ([fr.wikisource.org][1])

* If it’s more like the Arabic or Persian folktale tradition (or the *Mille et Une Nuits* type), many tales were oral for centuries, then written down around the medieval period and later translated/westernized in the 18-19th centuries.

* If modern, then probably 20th or 21st century — but since I found no mention, it may still be quite obscure.

## Is there an English version?

Since I could not find the French original (under that name) in verified sources, I likewise did **not** find an English version. If you can locate a copy of the story or more details (author, place you heard it, when, medium — book / radio / family / etc.), then it might be possible someone translated it, or one could translate it.

## What you can try to pinpoint more

To get closer to identifying the story, you might check:

* Are you sure of the spelling? “Pesan” might be mis-heard — maybe “Paysan”, “Pesan” could be “Pisan”, “Persan”, “Pezan”, or something non-French.
* “Isaphar” – could it be something like *Isfahan* (a Persian city), or *Iskander* / *Ishafar* etc?
* Where did you hear it (region, country, radio / tv / family)? That might hint language origin.
* Approximate time: how old was the version (modern, old, told by grandparents)?

If you want, I can try to search multi-lingual folklore databases, or check in Arabic, Persian, etc., to see whether something close to “Prince Pesan” shows up. Would you like me to do that?
