In the context of all the literature you have read in all the different languages you have read it, what would you say are the three most important stories for humanity?
Do you have an impression that there are some commonly occuring universal stories that get told and retold and never cease to fascinate people (or teach them something)?
Or do you get the impression that the stories are infinite and always changing and its impossible to simplify things down at all?
