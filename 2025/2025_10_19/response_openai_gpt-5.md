Great set of questions — nice detective work on the video. I’ll do three things:

1. quick reality-check on your interpretation + short context on Jack Stratton & James Jamerson, and what likely happened copyright/monetization-wise (with sources),
2. short legal/rights summary (what giving credit does — and doesn’t — accomplish), and
3. a practical, concrete guide + architecture (Vue + TypeScript front-end, JSON data model, SVG rendering approach, authoring UI ideas, and an export pipeline to MP4) with sample code sketches and tips you can actually start using.

I looked up the video and background material while preparing this so the claims below are sourced.

---

# 1) Your analysis — mostly spot on (and a couple extra facts)

* What you described visually (thin blue-ish contour path of the bassline, filled blue dots that lose fill when the note is struck, dot radius representing note duration, and a “follower” dot that borrows radius/fill and fades between notes) is an excellent and accurate reading of the effect Jack Stratton made. Several writeups copy that description when linking the video. ([YouTube][1])

* Who Jack Stratton is: he’s the founder / bandleader of Vulfpeck and a multi-instrumentalist / producer who also makes videos and visual work like this. He’s known for production/video experiments and for celebrating pocket players / groove players with visual projects. (So yes — he’s a musician and video-maker; not primarily a guitarist/singer in the public bio — he plays many instruments and produces.) ([Wikipedia][2])

* Who James Jamerson is: Jamerson was the legendary Motown session bassist (the “Funk Brothers”), uncredited on many 1960s hits; he’s widely regarded as one of the greatest bass players and famously played with a single-finger technique and extraordinary feel. Stratton’s video is plainly an act of reverence for Jamerson’s lines. ([Wikipedia][3])

So — you haven’t missed any big structural/interpretive details. Nice reading.

# 2) Copyright / YouTube monetization — the important short version

* **Giving credit ≠ permission.** Credit in the description doesn’t replace a license or permission. Uploading another artist’s recording will be scanned by YouTube’s Content ID on upload. The rights holder can (a) block, (b) monetize (place ads & take revenue), or (c) just track views. Often music is monetized by the rights owner rather than the uploader. ([Google Support][4])

* **Practical consequence for Stratton’s video:** most likely the recording is claimed by Motown/Universal (or their publisher/label). That generally means any ad revenue is routed to the rights owner, not necessarily to the uploader — unless the owner explicitly shares revenue. You cannot assume he’s receiving the ad money simply because the video exists and has views. (I didn’t find a public statement from Stratton about licensing that specific upload; there are fan/press writeups about the visualization.) ([Open Culture][5])

* If you want to **upload** somebody else’s *original recorded track* as the audio bed for your visualisation, you should either:

  1. obtain a sync license from the copyright owner/publisher (needed to pair the recording/composition with visuals), and possibly a master license from the record label to use the sound recording; **or**
  2. be prepared that Content ID will likely match it and the rights holder may monetize or block the video — uploading without a license risks that. Content ID/claims are common; there are remedies (dispute if you have rights, or request a license). ([Google Support][4])

(I'm not a lawyer — if you plan to monetize a video commercially, consult music-licensing counsel or your publisher.)

# 3) How to **create a similar visualization** — full, practical plan

Below is a complete pipeline: authoring UI, data model, visualization, and export route that will let you make MP4s suitable for YouTube. After the plan I give key code sketches and options.

## Overview (high level)

1. **Transcription / Data creation** — convert the bass performance into a time-sequenced dataset: `[{t_start, t_end, midi_pitch, velocity}]`. (Manual or assisted.)
2. **Authoring UI (Vue + TypeScript + PrimeVue)** — load MP3, display waveform, step through audio, add/adjust note events, live preview of the SVG visualization.
3. **SVG-based renderer** — generate an SVG at chosen resolution per frame (or render in-browser with requestAnimationFrame) that draws:

   * a smooth contour path from pitch/time values,
   * note dots at the timestamp with radius ∝ duration,
   * a follower dot that travels the contour and interpolates radius/fill,
   * visual effects (glow/softness) using SVG filters/blur so it looks like an old monitor/oscilloscope.
4. **Export** — render frames headlessly (Puppeteer) or record animation off-screen and convert to MP4 with ffmpeg, or use a server-side script (Node/ffmpeg or Python/moviepy) to stitch frames/audio together.

---

## Data model (JSON)

A tiny, explicit example schema you can edit:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Ain't No Mountain - Jamerson style",
    "bpm": 120,
    "sampleRate": 44100
  },
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "start": 0.234,        // seconds
      "duration": 0.280,     // seconds
      "midi": 45,            // MIDI pitch (A2 = 45)
      "velocity": 0.85       // 0..1
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "start": 0.800,
      "duration": 0.160,
      "midi": 50,
      "velocity": 0.60
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

You can extend each note with annotation fields, color, or grouping.

---

## Authoring UI (Vue + TS + PrimeVue) — components

* `AudioLoader` — load MP3/OGG; show waveform using **wavesurfer.js** (works well with Vue) so users can scrub and zoom.
* `NoteEditor` — piano-roll-ish small grid: click on waveform/piano roll to create note; edit start/duration/pitch/velocity. Keyboard shortcuts for nudging/time quantize.
* `PreviewCanvas` — renders the SVG preview live from JSON data (TypeScript transforms JSON → path + dots).
* `ExportPanel` — choose resolution, fps, mp4/codec; start export (local: Puppeteer + ffmpeg; server: flask endpoint that calls ffmpeg/moviepy).

You can wire PrimeVue components for dialogs, sliders (velocity), spinners, file pickers, etc.

## SVG rendering approach — how to reproduce the look

### mapping

* x = time → map to width (e.g., 0..songLength → 0..W).
* y = pitch → map pitch range to height (higher pitch → smaller y). Use some padding.
* each note at `start` has a dot centered at `(x(start), y(pitch))`.
* radius r = `scale(duration)` (clamped min/max). Velocity can drive initial fill opacity.

### contour path

* create a polyline of sample points along the timeline: either:

  1. create points at each note onset (and optionally at interpolated times) and `d="M ... C ..."` cubic-spline the points for a smooth flowing line; or
  2. resample a continuous pitch curve (if you have continuous pitch) and use `path` with `stroke-linecap="round"`.
* in code you can use a small Hermite or Catmull-Rom spline to produce a smooth path.

### note dots & animation

* On each dot, the initial state is **filled**; when the note is actually *plucked* (i.e., at `start` in the playback/preview timeline) animate the fill to transparent (a quick transition), while leaving the ring stroke visible so it reads like a “note was there”.
* radius gives duration — long notes show as bigger rings.
* the follower dot:

  * follow the contour path with a position parameter `s` (0..1 along path) computed from playback time → path-length mapping.
  * when follower encounters a not-yet-triggered dot (within a small distance threshold), it adopts that dot’s radius & fill state and then decays (multiply radius by ~0.98 per note or over time) so the follower visually borrows the note’s “energy” and fades between events.

### softness/"out of focus" look

* Use SVG `<filter>` with a subtle `feGaussianBlur` and `feMerge` to create glow; blend modes (CSS `mix-blend-mode`) or `feBlend` can give that phosphor/CRT feel.
* Add a very subtle grain overlay (low-opacity PNG or pattern) and a slight color aberration (duplicate the main layer shifted 0.5-1 px, tint slightly) — gives old-monitor/oscilloscope vibe.

### performance

* For live previews at 60fps keep DOM nodes small: render contour as one `<path>`, notes as many `<circle>` but consider using `<g>` and `transform` rather than changing `cx/cy` attributes constantly. For export you’ll render frame-by-frame to raster.

---

## Implementation sketches

### 1) Converting notes → SVG path (TypeScript sketch)

```ts
// helper: convert note list to points
function notesToPoints(notes: Note[], songLen: number, W: number, H: number, pitchMin: number, pitchMax: number) {
  return notes.map(n => {
    const x = (n.start / songLen) * W;
    const pitchNorm = (n.midi - pitchMin) / (pitchMax - pitchMin);
    const y = H - (pitchNorm * H) - 20; // padding
    return {x, y, note: n};
  });
}

// simple Catmull-Rom to cubic path generator (pseudocode)
function catmullRomToPath(points: {x:number,y:number}[]) {
  if (points.length === 0) return '';
  if (points.length === 1) return `M ${points[0].x} ${points[0].y}`;
  // generate smooth path; many small libs exist — use your implementation or a tiny helper
  // returns SVG d string
}
```

### 2) Follower behavior (pseudocode)

```ts
// at each animation tick with currentTime t (s)
const follower = {pos: 0 /*0..1*/, radius: baseR, fillAlpha:1};
function tick(t) {
  // map t to path length fraction s
  const s = t / songLen; // if path maps linearly to time; better: map by per-note segments for exact times
  const {x,y} = pathPointAtFraction(s);
  follower.x = x; follower.y = y;
  // check nearest note onset not yet fired
  nearest = findNearestUnfiredDot(follower, thresholdPx);
  if (nearest) {
    follower.radius = nearest.radius;
    follower.fillAlpha = nearest.fillAlpha;
    // mark the nearest as 'touched' if you want that behavior
  }
  // gradual decay:
  follower.radius *= 0.995; // tiny shrink each frame
}
```

### 3) Vue component outline

* `PreviewCanvas.vue` will receive `notes` and `songLength` props and render an `<svg>` sized at `W x H`.
* Use `requestAnimationFrame` to update follower position if playing.
* Use CSS animations or `animate()` for individual circle fills.

I can write a polished Vue single-file component for you on request (I usually prefer to iterate), but the above is the working recipe.

---

## 4) Exporting to MP4 (practical, reliable approach)

Two main strategies:

### A — Local headless rendering (recommended if you want a purely frontend workflow)

1. Host your app locally (e.g., `npm run start`) and build an export mode URL that renders the visualization in a deterministic way (no UI, but plays timeline automatically).
2. Use **Puppeteer** (Node) to open that export URL in headless Chrome at desired **width × height**, advance the playback timestamp in JS every frame, and capture screenshots at each frame (or use Chrome’s `page.screenshot()` per frame).
3. Pipe the PNG sequence into **ffmpeg** to encode `mp4` and mux the audio track (the original mp3) back in:

Example commands (conceptual):

```bash
# from Node: produce frames frame_%06d.png
# then:
ffmpeg -r 30 -i frame_%06d.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k -shortest out.mp4
```

Puppeteer code will `await page.evaluate(() => window.setPlaybackTime(t))` for each frame t and then `page.screenshot()`.

### B — Server-side render with Python moviepy (if you prefer Python)

* Use a server API to receive JSON and generate frames using `cairosvg` (svg → png) or render in headless browser and then use `moviepy` to compose video + audio. MoviePy is simpler for stitching audio and scaling.

Both routes are standard industry practice. Puppeteer + ffmpeg is robust for exact browser-based SVG rendering (so your in-browser look matches exported frames).

## 5) Tools & tricks for transcription / getting MIDI-like data

* **Manual**: Use your ears + wavesurfer + the piano-roll editor to hand-enter note onsets/durations.
* **Assisted**:

  * **Sonic Visualiser** (desktop) – good for pitch track inspection, and you can export notes.
  * **Melodyne** (commercial) – excellent pitch/time extraction for monophonic bass; export as MIDI.
  * **Open-source**: `librosa` (Python) for onset detection & pitch tracking; `crepe` or `onsets-and-frames` models (vocal pitch trackers) can produce note events you can post-process. These are not perfect for electric bass in dense mixes, but will speed up work.
* After automated extraction, correct manually in your editor — this is the usual workflow.

---

## 6) Visual style tips to match Stratton’s look

* color palette: desaturated blue for main line (e.g. `#7fb5ff` mid), darker blue stroke for dots, very transparent fill when “active”.
* gaussian blur / glow filter tuned low (0.6–2 px) to get the “soft phosphor” look.
* use `stroke-linecap="round"` and `stroke-width` variations to get that smooth pen/oscilloscope feel.
* add a faint vignette and a screen-scanline overlay (very low alpha) for the old monitor look.

---

## 7) Example export flow (concrete steps you can run)

1. Build the Vue app with editor + preview.
2. Author the JSON for a song by manual/assisted transcription.
3. Start a local headless export server route: `http://localhost:3000/export?sessionId=XYZ`.
4. Run a Node exporter script that:

   * launches Puppeteer,
   * opens the export URL,
   * for each frame `i` (i = 0..N-1) computes `t = i / fps`,
   * `await page.evaluate(() => window.setTime(t))` to set preview to exact time,
   * `await page.screenshot({path: 'frames/frame_%06d.png'})`.
5. `ffmpeg -r 30 -i frames/frame_%06d.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -shortest out.mp4`
6. Upload `out.mp4` to YouTube (but remember licensing/Content ID).

---

## 8) Starter code & file structure (suggestion)

```
bassviz/
├─ frontend/   (Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript + PrimeVue)
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ components/PreviewCanvas.vue
│  │  ├─ components/NoteEditor.vue
│  │  └─ App.vue
│  └─ export-mode.html?session=...
├─ exporter/
│  ├─ puppeteer-export.js
│  └─ package.json
├─ scripts/
│  └─ ffmpeg-assemble.sh
└─ data/
   └─ mytrack.json
```

If you want, I can generate a minimal `PreviewCanvas.vue` that draws the contour + dots from the JSON and includes a playhead/follower — say a single-file component you can paste into a Vite + Vue app. (I can also produce a starter Puppeteer exporter script.)

If you want, next steps I can do **right now** (pick any one and I’ll run with it in this reply):

* produce a fully working `PreviewCanvas.vue` (Vue 3 + TypeScript) component that loads a small hard-coded JSON and shows the contour + dots + follower (no backend/export yet), or
* provide a concrete Puppeteer `export.js` script you can use to render frames from an `export-mode` URL, or
* draft the WAV/MP3 licensing checklist + short email template to request sync/master licenses from a publisher/label.

Which of those would be most useful to you right now? (If you want the Vue component, I’ll include it complete and ready to paste into a Vite project.)
