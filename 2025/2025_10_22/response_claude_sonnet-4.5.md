This is a fascinating project! I love the thoughtfulness you're bringing to it - the desire for both structure and flexibility, the focus on portability and future-proofing, and especially the idea of building it gradually as a satisfying daily practice. Let me help you think through this systematically.

## Core Recommendations

**1. Folder Structure: Date-based + Unique ID**
Your instinct about date-based folders is good for your use case (rare/white label tracks). I'd suggest:

```
library/
├── tracks/
│   ├── 2025-10-22_001/
│   │   ├── audio.mp3
│   │   ├── metadata.json
│   │   └── artwork.jpg (optional separate)
│   ├── 2025-10-22_002/
│   └── 2025-10-23_001/
└── index.json (master catalog)
```

The date + counter gives you a built-in chronological ID and lets you see your progress over time.

**2. Metadata Storage: JSON files + ID3 tags (hybrid approach)**

Store metadata in **both** places:
- **JSON files** (one per track): Your detailed research, relationships, notes, custom fields
- **ID3 tags in MP3**: Essential info (artist, title, album, BPM, key, year, embedded artwork)

This gives you the best of both worlds: portability for casual sharing (ID3 tags travel with the file) and rich extensibility (JSON for everything else).

**3. Metadata Schema**

Here's a suggested JSON structure:

```json
{
  "id": "2025-10-22_001",
  "added_date": "2025-10-22",
  "file": {
    "path": "audio.mp3",
    "original_filename": "rare_track_vinyl_rip.mp3",
    "source": "yt-dlp",
    "source_url": "https://..."
  },
  "basic": {
    "title": "Track Name",
    "artist": "Artist Name",
    "album": "Album Name",
    "year": 2020,
    "month": 6,
    "duration_seconds": 245
  },
  "musical": {
    "bpm": 128,
    "key": "A minor",
    "genre": ["House", "Deep House"],
    "structure": "Intro(32) - Verse(64) - Chorus(32) - Break(16)..."
  },
  "credits": {
    "producers": ["Producer Name"],
    "writers": ["Writer Name"],
    "label": "Label Name",
    "catalog_number": "CAT001"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "related_tracks": ["2025-10-15_003", "2025-09-12_008"],
    "remixes_of": null,
    "sampled_in": []
  },
  "research": {
    "notes": "Found this on a white label...",
    "story": "This was produced in the same session as...",
    "links": ["https://discogs.com/..."]
  },
  "tags": ["rare", "white-label", "unreleased"],
  "artwork": {
    "embedded": true,
    "file": "artwork.jpg"
  }
}
```

**4. About Standards**

DJ software standards exist but they're not ideal for your needs:
- **Serato/Traktor**: Use proprietary databases, not portable
- **Rekordbox**: XML export, but complex
- **MusicBrainz Picard**: Great for tagging, uses open standards (ID3v2.4)

For maximum compatibility, use **ID3v2.4 tags** in your MP3s - this is the most universal standard. Tools like [mutagen (Python)](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/) make this easy to automate.

**5. Git for Version Control**

**Do this**: Git repo for JSON files and code
**Don't do this**: Store MP3s in Git

Create two directories:
- `music-library/` (Git repo) - JSON metadata, scripts, website code
- `music-library-audio/` (outside Git) - Actual MP3 files, backed up separately

Your JSON can reference audio files by relative path or ID.

**6. Making It Manageable & Enjoyable**

Here's how to keep this fun:

**Start minimal**: 
- Day 1: Just add one track with basic info (title, artist, BPM)
- Day 2: Add another track, experiment with adding more fields
- Gradually expand your schema as you discover what matters to you

**Build tools incrementally**:
1. Week 1: Simple Python script to create a new track entry from a template
2. Week 2: Script to sync JSON → ID3 tags
3. Week 3: Simple HTML page that lists your tracks
4. Week 4: Add a player to that page
5. Month 2: Add search/filter capabilities

**Daily workflow** (10 minutes):
```bash
# Add new track
python add_track.py --file rare_track.mp3

# Opens editor with metadata template
# Fill in what you know, leave rest blank

# Generates dated folder, moves file, creates JSON
# Commits to git with message "Added: Track Name"

# View progress
python generate_site.py
# Opens local website showing your collection
```

**7. Tools to Consider**

- **beets**: Music library manager with plugins for BPM detection, key detection, metadata fetching
- **MusicBrainz Picard**: For initial tagging/artwork
- **Essentia** or **librosa**: Python libraries for analyzing BPM/key
- **Obsidian vault**: Could work well! Each track could be a note with frontmatter (YAML/JSON) and body for story/research

**8. The Website/Player**

Build a simple static site generator:
- Reads all JSON files
- Generates browsable HTML
- Includes audio player (HTML5 `<audio>`)
- Shows relationships as clickable links
- Could use a simple framework like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) or even just vanilla JS

## Suggested Starting Point

**Week 1 Goal**: Get 5 tracks added with basic metadata and a simple webpage showing them.

1. Create the folder structure
2. Write a simple `add_track.py` script that creates the dated folder and template JSON
3. Manually fill in metadata for 5 tracks
4. Write a simple `generate_html.py` that creates an index.html from your JSON files
5. Commit everything to Git

Once you have this foundation working and feel the satisfaction of seeing your work accumulate, you can gradually add more sophisticated features.

**The key insight**: Start with something that works in 10 minutes per day, then evolve it. Don't try to build the perfect system upfront - let it grow organically with your collection.

Would you like me to create a starter script for any of these components? I could make a simple track-adding tool or a basic static site generator to help you get started.
