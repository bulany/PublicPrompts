Of course. It sounds like a fantastic and rewarding project! To keep it manageable, enjoyable, and future-proof, I'd suggest a hybrid approach that combines the best of standardized, embedded metadata with the flexibility of external, human-readable notes.

Here's a breakdown of how you could proceed.

***

## The Core Strategy: A Hybrid Approach

Your core dilemma is between embedding all data in the MP3 or keeping it in sidecar files (like JSON). The best solution is to **do both**, but for different kinds of data.

* **For universal data (The "Public" Info):** Embed standard metadata directly into the MP3 files using **ID3 tags**. This includes things like Artist, Album, Title, Year, Genre, BPM, Artwork, and even initial comments. This ensures that when you share an MP3, it's immediately useful and informative on any standard player. This is the "mixtape"-friendly part of your plan.
* **For rich, personal data (The "Private" Stories):** Use external **Markdown (`.md`) files** for your detailed notes, stories, producer links, song structure analysis, and relationships between tracks. This keeps your personal research separate, easy to back up, and incredibly flexible. I highly recommend this over JSON because Markdown is designed to be written and read by humans.

This hybrid system gives you maximum portability for the music files and maximum flexibility for your personal encyclopedia of music knowledge.

## Recommended Tools & Setup

To make this workflow smooth, you'll need a few key pieces of software. All of these are highly regarded and free.

1.  **For Automatic Tagging: [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/)**
    This should be your first step. Picard "listens" to your audio files, identifies them using an acoustic fingerprint, and pulls down a wealth of accurate metadata from the massive MusicBrainz database. It can automatically find and embed the release year, producer credits, official artwork, and more. It saves you an enormous amount of research time.

2.  **For Manual Tagging & Finessing: [Mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)**
    After Picard does the heavy lifting, Mp3tag is perfect for fine-tuning. You can easily add custom tags like **Musical Key** and **BPM**, check consistency, and manage embedded artwork. It's an indispensable tool for detailed tag management.

3.  **For Your Stories & Connections: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** ‚úçÔ∏è
    You mentioned it, and it's the perfect choice. Think of Obsidian not just as a note-taking app, but as a personal wiki for your music.
    * **Plain Text:** Your entire collection of notes is just a folder of `.md` files, making it completely future-proof.
    * **Linking:** This is its superpower. You can effortlessly link tracks, artists, and producers. You could write "...this bassline was inspired by [[Artist - Another Song]] and was produced by [[Producer Name]]." Clicking those links will take you directly to the notes for that song or producer. This builds the interconnected web you described.
    * **The "Website":** Obsidian *is* your custom website. It has a built-in player for local audio files and displays all your beautifully formatted notes and images.

## A Manageable Daily Workflow (Your 10 Minutes)

Here‚Äôs how you can make progress in small, satisfying chunks.

#### **Step 1: Folder & File Structure** üóÇÔ∏è

First, decide on a structure. Instead of dating folders by when you *added* the file, it's more robust to organize by the music's own data. A classic, effective structure is:

`Music/Artist Name/Album Name/Track Number - Song Title.mp3`

For rare tracks or singles, you could use:

`Music/Artist Name/[Singles]/Release Year - Song Title.mp3`
`Music/[White Labels]/Artist - Title (Label Year).mp3`

Create an `_INBOX` folder where you drop new, unprocessed files. This keeps your main library clean.

#### **Step 2: The 10-Minute Process** üé∂

1.  **Acquire:** Grab a new track or two and drop them into your `_INBOX` folder.
2.  **Process with Picard:** Drag the files from your `_INBOX` into Picard. Let it identify the track and save the core metadata (Artist, Title, Album, Year) to the file.
3.  **Move the File:** Move the newly-tagged MP3 from the `_INBOX` to its permanent home in your `Artist/Album/` structure. Picard can even do this for you automatically based on the tags.
4.  **Fine-Tune with Mp3tag:** Open the file in Mp3tag. Add the BPM, musical key, or any other specific standard tags Picard might have missed. Embed your preferred high-quality artwork.
5.  **Create the Story in Obsidian:**
    * Create a new note in your Obsidian vault. A good title would be `Artist - Song Title.md`.
    * In this note, you can add a link to play the local file: `[Play Song](file:///path/to/your/Music/Artist/Album/Track%20-%20Song%20Title.mp3)`
    * Now, do the fun part! Write down your research: the story behind the song, notes on the lyrics, links to the producer `[[Producer Name]]`, and connections to other tracks `[[Another Song]]`.

That's it! In 10-15 minutes, you've permanently added a track to your library, enriched it with standard tags, and added your own unique knowledge in a linked, searchable way. The next day, you can open Obsidian and see exactly where you left off.

## Answering Your Specific Concerns

* **DJ Software (Serato, Traktor):** They primarily read the **embedded ID3 tags**. The workflow above is perfectly compatible. They will see the Artist, Title, BPM, Key, and Artwork you've embedded, making your collection instantly ready for DJing. They will simply ignore your separate Obsidian notes.
* **Backups & Git:** Your idea to use Git is excellent, but **only for your Obsidian vault (the `.md` files)**. Do NOT put your MP3 files in a standard Git repository; their binary nature will make the repository astronomically large and slow.
    * **Your Metadata:** The Obsidian vault is just text. It's tiny and perfect for Git. `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push` every day to have a versioned history of all your research.
    * **Your Music Files:** Back up the actual `Music` folder using a standard backup solution like an external hard drive, a cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive), or a synchronization tool like Syncthing.
* **Rebuilding from Metadata:** Your vision is spot-on. If you lost your MP3s, your Obsidian vault would be an incredible "scavenger hunt" list. The notes would contain the Artist, Title, and Year, making it relatively easy to write a script to find those tracks again on services like YouTube or Spotify.
