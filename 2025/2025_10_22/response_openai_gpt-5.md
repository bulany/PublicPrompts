That’s a beautiful project idea — it combines digital archiving, storytelling, and curation in a very human way. I think you’re on the right track conceptually, and with a few key design decisions early on, you could absolutely make this both **manageable and fun** to grow over time. Let’s break it down into **practical, scalable layers** so it feels less overwhelming and remains future-proof.

---

## 🌳 1. Core Principles

Before any folder or code, define these **guiding rules**:

* **Flat text for metadata** — use plain `.json` or `.md` files that live alongside each track.
* **MP3s optional in repo** — store audio outside Git (to keep the repo lightweight).
* **Incremental updates** — every small session (10 min/day) adds a little bit of story, not a giant batch.
* **Human-readable and automatable** — you should be able to open a folder and instantly know what’s there, but also write a script later to parse everything.
* **Web-viewable output** — eventually you’ll have a simple “record shelf” website that pulls from your metadata.

---

## 📁 2. Suggested Folder Structure

Here’s a simple, scalable structure that works with your “daily session” idea:

```
music-library/
│
├── tracks/
│   ├── 2025_10_22/
│   │   ├── some-cool-track.mp3
│   │   ├── some-cool-track.json
│   │   └── cover.jpg
│   ├── 2025_10_23/
│   │   ├── another-track.mp3
│   │   ├── another-track.json
│   │   └── cover.jpg
│   └── ...
│
├── artists/
│   ├── artist-name.json
│   └── ...
│
├── producers/
│   ├── producer-name.json
│   └── ...
│
└── _meta/
    ├── mixtapes/
    │   ├── chill-evening.json
    │   └── ...
    └── tags.json
```

This keeps your additions atomic — one folder per day of work.

---

## 🧠 3. JSON Metadata Format

Each track can have a `.json` with structured metadata. Example:

```json
{
  "title": "My Rare Groove",
  "artist": "DJ Hidden Gem",
  "release_year": 1996,
  "release_month": 4,
  "bpm": 124,
  "key": "A minor",
  "duration": "04:35",
  "genre": ["house", "deep"],
  "added_date": "2025-10-22",
  "source": {
    "type": "YouTube",
    "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx"
  },
  "producer": ["John Doe"],
  "related_tracks": ["track-id-2025-10-12", "track-id-2025-10-15"],
  "notes": "Sampled from a 1978 soul record. Unreleased white label.",
  "cover": "cover.jpg"
}
```

You could also include a short markdown-style description section:

```json
{
  "description": "This track is part of the **Deep Dubs** series by DJ Hidden Gem..."
}
```

---

## 💡 4. Naming and ID Convention

You don’t need UUIDs. Your **internal ID** could just be the date + filename stem.

Example:

* File: `tracks/2025_10_22/my-rare-groove.mp3`
* ID: `2025_10_22_my-rare-groove`

That ID can be referenced in related track fields, playlists, etc.

---

## 🧩 5. Tools and Workflow

### Daily flow idea

1. Create a new folder named with today’s date.
2. Drop your MP3s in.
3. Run a small script that generates `.json` stubs for each new MP3:

   ```bash
   ./tools/new-track.sh tracks/2025_10_22/*.mp3
   ```

   It could fill in the file name, duration (via ffprobe), and template fields.
4. Open each JSON in your editor (or Obsidian!) and fill in your notes.
5. Commit changes (without MP3s):

   ```bash
   git add -u
   git commit -m "Added notes for 2025_10_22 session"
   ```
6. Optionally push metadata to GitHub.

---

## 💾 6. Keeping MP3s Out of Git

You have a few options:

* **Store MP3s locally or on an external drive**, and just keep relative paths in JSON.
* **Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)** if you want some tracks versioned in GitHub without bloating your repo.
* **Or** host MP3s in a cloud drive (e.g., Nextcloud, Dropbox) and refer to them by URL.

Example field:

```json
"file": "../audio/2025_10_22/my-rare-groove.mp3"
```

---

## 🔗 7. Compatibility & Open Standards

If you want this to play nicely with DJ software in the future:

* **TagLib** (used by many players) can embed your metadata into ID3 tags.
* **Serato** and **Rekordbox** both use XML/SQLite databases, but not open formats. Still, you can export your JSON metadata to them later if needed.
* **MusicBrainz Picard** uses JSON/XML and could integrate with your schema fairly easily if you ever want to enrich your data with public metadata.

So yes — you’re already leaning toward an “open standard”: JSON + ID3 is a great choice.

---

## 🌐 8. Optional Website Frontend

Once you have a few tracks catalogued, you can easily build a static site generator around your JSON files:

* Use **Eleventy**, **Astro**, or even a small **Deno script**.
* The site can show:

  * Most recently added tracks.
  * Track detail pages (pull JSON → render markdown).
  * Links between related tracks.
  * Embedded `<audio>` players.
  * Tag and BPM filters.

You could even auto-generate an “index” page sorted by date.

---

## 🧭 9. Using Obsidian (optional but excellent)

You can treat your library as an **Obsidian vault**, where:

* Each `.json` or `.md` file is a “note”.
* You use backlinks to connect artists, producers, etc.
* You visualize relationships with the graph view.
* You use the Dataview plugin to query your library (e.g., show all tracks with bpm > 120 added this month).

## 🧰 10. Suggested Tech Stack (Minimal to Start)

| Task                                    | Tool                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| JSON template generation                | Bash/Python script                    |
| Extract audio info (duration, bpm, key) | `ffprobe`, `essentia`, or `music21`   |
| Optional embedded metadata              | `mutagen` (Python)                    |
| Website generation                      | Eleventy / Astro / custom Node script |
| Note editing                            | Obsidian or VS Code                   |
| Backup/versioning                       | Git (metadata only)                   |

---

## ✨ Final Thoughts

If you build this slowly, the project can become something *deeply satisfying* — a kind of living music journal and discovery engine.
Start small:

* Create the `tracks/2025_10_22/` folder.
* Add one MP3.
* Create its `.json` and fill in just three fields: title, artist, bpm.
* Commit and view it in your editor.

If it feels good after a few sessions, you can automate the boring bits later.

Would you like me to help you design the **exact JSON schema and folder template**, including a script to auto-generate new track entries (e.g. `new-track.sh`)? That would make starting the daily workflow as easy as running one command.
