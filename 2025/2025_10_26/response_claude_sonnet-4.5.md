# Origins of Grammatical Gender in French

The masculine/feminine divide in French comes from **Latin**, which itself inherited a three-gender system (masculine, feminine, neuter) from Proto-Indo-European. As Latin evolved into Old French, the neuter gender gradually disappeared, with neuter nouns being absorbed into the masculine category.

## Is There Logic to Gender Assignment?

There's **some** logic, but it's complex and inconsistent:

### Biological sex (when applicable)
- *un homme* (man), *une femme* (woman) follow natural gender
- Animal names can vary: *un éléphant* (elephant) is masculine even for females, unless you specify *une éléphante*

### Etymological patterns from Latin
- Latin words ending in *-a* (typically feminine) → French feminine: *porta* → *porte* (door, feminine)
- Latin words ending in *-us* (typically masculine) → French masculine: *focus* → *feu* (fire, masculine)

### Word endings in French
Some patterns emerged:
- Words ending in *-tion*, *-té*, *-ette* tend to be feminine
- Words ending in *-age*, *-ment*, *-eau* tend to be masculine
- But there are many exceptions!

### For your examples:
- **Voiture** (car): comes from Latin *vectura* (transport), feminine ending → feminine
- **Feu** (fire): from Latin *focus* (hearth), masculine → masculine

The gender often has **nothing to do with the concept itself** being "masculine" or "feminine" in character—it's mostly historical accident based on Latin word forms.

## English and Grammatical Gender

**Yes!** Old English (Anglo-Saxon) had a full three-gender system like Latin: masculine, feminine, and neuter. For example:
- *se stān* (the stone, masculine)
- *sēo giefu* (the gift, feminine)  
- *þæt scip* (the ship, neuter)

This system gradually **collapsed between roughly 1000-1400 CE** during the Middle English period, influenced by:
- The Norman Conquest (1066) bringing French influence
- Phonetic erosion of word endings that marked gender
- Extensive language contact simplifying the grammar

By modern English, grammatical gender had been almost entirely replaced by natural gender (he/she for biological sex, it for everything else), though traces remain in pronouns and some traditional usages (like ships as "she").

So English speakers today struggle with French gender partly because our language *lost* a feature our ancestors once had!
