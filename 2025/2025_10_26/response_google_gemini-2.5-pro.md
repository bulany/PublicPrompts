Here's a breakdown of the origins and logic of grammatical gender in French and English.

## The Origin of French Gender

The masculine/feminine divide in French is a direct inheritance from its parent language, **Latin**.

* **From Three Genders to Two:** Vulgar Latin (the common speech that evolved into French) had three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. As the language evolved into Old French, the neuter gender gradually disappeared.
* **Neuter Merged with Masculine:** Most neuter nouns from Latin were absorbed into the masculine gender in French. This is a primary reason why there are significantly more masculine nouns than feminine ones.
* **What Determines Gender?** For the most part, a noun's gender in modern French is determined by its **etymology** (the gender of the Latin word it came from) and its **form** (like its ending). It has almost nothing to do with the object's actual properties.

## Is There Any Logic to It?

You're right to be confused—there is **no logic linked to the actual, real-world "gender"** of an object. The terms "masculine" and "feminine" are just linguistic labels for noun categories.

The logic is purely **linguistic and historical**. Your examples are perfect illustrations:

* **`Une voiture` (a car) is feminine** because it comes from the Latin word *vectūra*, which means "transport" or "carriage." *Vectūra* was a feminine noun in Latin, and French simply kept its gender.
* **`Un feu` (a fire) is masculine** for two reasons. It comes from the Latin word *focus* (which meant "hearth" or "fireplace" and was masculine), but it also fits a common pattern: words ending in *-eu* in French are almost always masculine.

Other patterns exist, like words ending in *-tion* (`la nation`) being feminine, while words ending in *-age* (`le garage`) are usually masculine. But these are just patterns, not ironclad rules, and they all stem from how the language evolved from Latin.

## Did English Have Genders?

**Yes, absolutely.** English or, more accurately, its ancestor **Old English** (spoken from roughly 450 to 1150 AD) had a complex grammatical gender system.

* **Three Genders:** Like Latin, Old English had three genders: **masculine, feminine, and neuter**.
* **Just as "Illogical":** This system was also grammatical, not logical. The word for "woman" (*wīf*) was neuter, while the word for "maiden" or "girl" (*mægden*) was also neuter.
* **Why Did It Disappear?** The gender system began to fade away during the Middle English period (after 1066). The Norman conquest (who spoke Old French) and heavy influence from Old Norse (which also had gender, but with different rules) led to a simplification of English grammar. The case and gender endings on words were gradually dropped, and by the time of Chaucer, the system was essentially gone, leaving us with the "genderless" (or natural gender) system we use today.
