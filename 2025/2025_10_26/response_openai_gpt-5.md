Excellent questions — and they touch on one of the most fascinating (and confusing!) aspects of Indo-European linguistics. Let’s unpack it step by step.

### 🏛️ 1. Origins of grammatical gender

The **masculine/feminine divide in French** ultimately comes from **Proto-Indo-European (PIE)** — the reconstructed ancestor of most European and many Asian languages (including Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and the Germanic languages).

PIE originally had **two genders**:

* **Animate (for living things)**
* **Inanimate (for non-living things)**

Later, this system split the *animate* class into **masculine** and **feminine**, while the *inanimate* class became what we now call **neuter**.

From there:

* **Latin** inherited *masculine, feminine, and neuter*.
* Over time, **Latin evolved into Vulgar Latin**, where distinctions between masculine and feminine stayed, but the neuter category disappeared.
* In **Old French**, neuter nouns merged mostly with the masculine group — leaving the binary system (masc./fem.) that survives today.

So, the masculine/feminine divide in French isn’t originally about “real-world gender” — it’s a **grammatical inheritance** from a very old linguistic system.

### 🧩 2. Was there any logic related to biological sex?

At first, **partially yes**, but it quickly became **arbitrary**.

* In Proto-Indo-European, living male beings were masculine, living female beings were feminine, and inanimate things were neuter.
* But as the system evolved, **nouns for objects** were assigned gender based on:

  * **Word endings or sound patterns** (e.g., many -a endings became feminine in Latin).
  * **Analogy** (new words took the gender of similar words).
  * **Phonological changes** over centuries.

For example:

* *La voiture* comes from Latin *vectura* (“means of transport”), which ended in *-a* → a typical feminine ending in Latin → hence feminine in French.
* *Le feu* comes from Latin *focus* (“fire, hearth”), a masculine noun → hence masculine in French.

So the **gender of nouns is mostly etymological**, not logical or symbolic.
You can’t predict a noun’s gender by what it refers to — only by **its linguistic ancestry**.

### 🇬🇧 3. Did English ever have grammatical gender?

Yes — **Old English (Anglo-Saxon)** absolutely did.
Every noun was masculine, feminine, or neuter, just like in German today.

For instance:

* *stān* (stone) — masculine
* *sunne* (sun) — feminine
* *scip* (ship) — neuter

And adjectives and articles agreed with the noun’s gender.

However, after the **Norman Conquest (1066)**, English absorbed a flood of French vocabulary while also **simplifying its grammar**:

* Case endings eroded.
* Gender agreement disappeared.
* The **semantic gender** (based on actual sex) became dominant — “he,” “she,” “it” replaced grammatical gender.

So today, English only preserves **natural gender** (based on meaning) rather than grammatical gender.

### ⚖️ 4. Summary

| Stage               | Gender system                                | Example languages             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Proto-Indo-European | Animate / inanimate (later masc./fem./neut.) | Reconstructed ancestor        |
| Latin               | 3 genders                                    | Masculine, feminine, neuter   |
| Old French          | 2 genders (neuter merged with masculine)     | Masculine / feminine          |
| Modern French       | 2 genders                                    | Masculine / feminine          |
| Old English         | 3 genders                                    | Masculine / feminine / neuter |
| Modern English      | No grammatical gender                        | Only natural gender           |
