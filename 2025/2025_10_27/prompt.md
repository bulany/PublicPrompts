Why did "The Winstons" who recorded the hit single "Color Him Father" in 1969 call themselves "The Winstons" - none of the band members seem to have that first or last name?
In the lyrics of the song they say "I think I'll color this man 'father', I think I'll color him love..."... why do they use this strange grammatical construction?
What were they trying to mean by saying that?
