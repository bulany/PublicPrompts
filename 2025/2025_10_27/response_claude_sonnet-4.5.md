I'd be happy to help explain both the band name and the song's lyrics!

## The Band Name "The Winstons"

The Winstons were named after their lead singer, **Richard Spencer**, whose nickname was "Winston." So while none of the members had Winston as their legal first or last name, the band took its name from the frontman's nickname. This was a common practice in R&B and soul groups of that era - naming the band after a key member's nickname or stage name.

## The "Color Him" Phrase

The phrase "color him father" and "color him love" is indeed an unusual grammatical construction, but it was actually a recognizable idiom from that time period, particularly in African American Vernacular English.

The expression comes from the idea of coloring or filling in a picture - like a child's coloring book. When you say "color him [something]," you're essentially saying "label him as," "call him," or "consider him to be" that thing. It's a metaphorical way of defining or characterizing someone.

In the context of the song, which is told from the perspective of a child whose mother has remarried, the narrator is deciding to accept and define this new man in their life as their father figure. The "coloring" metaphor suggests:

1. **Filling in a blank space** - there was an absence (no father), and now it's being filled
2. **A deliberate choice** - the child is actively choosing to see this man as a father
3. **Creating something beautiful** - like coloring a picture, they're making something complete and whole

So "color him father" means "I choose to see him as/call him/accept him as my father," with the added emotional layer of it being a conscious, loving decision rather than just a biological fact.
