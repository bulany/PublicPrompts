Here's the breakdown of the band's name and the song's famous lyrics.

### The Band's Name

You're right, none of the known members of "The Winstons" (including Richard Lewis Spencer, the bandleader and songwriter) had the last name Winston.

Unfortunately, the specific reason **why they chose the name "The Winstons" is not well-documented** or widely available in public records or interviews. It remains an obscure piece of the band's history, which is primarily remembered for their one major hit and the iconic "Amen break" from its B-side.

### The Meaning of "Color Him Father"

The song's lyrics are a heartfelt tribute to a **stepfather**. The narrator is one of seven children whose biological father was "killed in the war." His mother, believing she could never love again, meets a new man who not only marries her but lovingly raises all seven children as his own.

The song describes this man's daily sacrificesâ€”working hard, coming home "tired and beat," and still having the love and strength to be a father figure.

#### The Grammatical Construction

The line, "I think I'll **color this man 'father'**," uses the word "color" in a less common, figurative way.

  * **What it means:** In this context, "to color" means **"to label," "to designate," or "to call."**
  * **The meaning:** The narrator is making a conscious and loving decision. He's saying, "This man may not be my biological father, but because of his love, his sacrifice, and the way he cares for our family, I am going to *designate* him as my father. In my heart and in my mind, I will 'color' him with the title of 'father' and 'love'."

This phrasing was likely a creative choice by the songwriter, Richard Lewis Spencer, possibly inspired by other contemporary songs like "My Coloring Book" (a hit in 1963) that used coloring as a metaphor for defining feelings and perceptions.

This track, [Color Him Father](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dg2W2m-1i-g0), tells the touching story of a boy's deep appreciation for his stepfather.
