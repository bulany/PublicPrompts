Both Strudel and Tone.js kind of have a goal of making music in the browser.
What are their fundamnetal architecture differences when it comes to interfacing with the Webaudio API?
I read somewhere that you can use Tone.js to make sounds with Strudel but eventually the author steered away from that because he found Tone.js unreliable or suffering from issues such as possible memory leaks.
Have major issues like that with Tone.js been officially identified in past versions and have they been addressed?
What is the timeline of recent major versions of Tone.js and what issues have been addressed?
