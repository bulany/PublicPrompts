I have a pdf file that is a musical score: Its Bohemian Rhapsody for SATTBB a capplla. 
It has a cover image, then 23 pages of musical score along 6 staves: SA, TI, TII, BB, and two staves of piano (for rehearsal only).
It looks like the pdf has been scanned from a paper score as sometimes the stave are not exactly horizontal etc
How would you go about converting this PDF to musicxml?
Are there any tried and tested workflows that you know of?
