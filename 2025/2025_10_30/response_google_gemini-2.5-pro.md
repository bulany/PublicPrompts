Of course. Converting a scanned 23-page, 8-stave PDF into an accurate MusicXML file is a challenging task, but it's definitely possible. The process relies on **Optical Music Recognition (OMR)** software.

Based on your description (scanned, multi-stave, not perfectly horizontal), you should be prepared: **no software will do this perfectly.** The "tried and tested workflow" is always a two-part process: automatic recognition followed by essential manual correction.

Here is the workflow and the tools you'll need.

### ðŸŽ¹ The Tried and Tested Workflow

This is the general process that musicians and engravers follow.

1.  **Step 1: OMR Recognition**
    You will use a dedicated OMR program to "read" your PDF. You import all 23 pages, and the software analyzes them, identifying staves, clefs, notes, rhythms, and lyrics.
    * Given your 8-stave (SATTBB + Piano) setup, the software will attempt to recognize all 8 staves on each page.
    * The "piano (for rehearsal only)" staves will just be treated as two more musical staves. You can easily delete or mute them later in your notation software.

2.  **Step 2: First-Pass Correction (In the OMR)**
    Some of the best OMR programs (like SmartScore) allow you to make corrections *before* you even export. This is highly recommended. You can fix obvious errors like missing bars, incorrect time signatures, or sections where the staves weren't identified correctly.

3.  **Step 3: Export to MusicXML**
    Once the OMR has done its best, you'll export the entire 23-page project as a `.musicxml` or `.xml` file. This file contains the core musical information, but not all the perfect visual formatting.

4.  **Step 4: Import & Final Proofreading (The Manual Part)**
    This is the most critical and time-consuming step. You will import that MusicXML file into a full-featured music notation program (like MuseScore, Sibelius, or Finale). Then, you must sit down with your original PDF and the new digital file side-by-side and **check every single measure**. The OMR *will* have made mistakes.

### Software Recommendations

You generally get what you pay for with OMR. For a score this complex, a free tool may cause more frustration than it's worth.

#### **Top Commercial Tools (Recommended for Your Score)**

* **SmartScore 64 Pro:** This is a long-standing favorite for complex projects. Its biggest advantage is its powerful **built-in editor**. You can fix many recognition errors *inside* SmartScore before exporting to MusicXML, which can save a lot of time. It's designed to handle multi-stave orchestral and choral scores.
* **PlayScore 2:** Originally a mobile app, this is now a very powerful OMR for desktop (Windows) as well. User reports often praise its high accuracy, sometimes even higher than other programs on tricky rhythms or tuplets. It explicitly handles SATB and piano music.
* **PhotoScore & NotateMe Ultimate:** This is the OMR engine that comes bundled (in a "Lite" version) with Sibelius. The full, "Ultimate" version is powerful and well-regarded, designed to integrate smoothly with Sibelius but also exports standard MusicXML.

#### **Free & Open-Source Option**

* **Audiveris:** This is the free, open-source engine that powers the "Import PDF" feature on the MuseScore website. You can also download and run the standalone application.
    * **The Catch:** Its results are very "hit or miss." For a clean, modern, digitally-created PDF, it can be excellent. For a dense, scanned score with imperfections like yours, it will likely struggle, leaving you with a lot of errors in rhythm, voicing, and text.

### Pro-Tips for the Manual Correction Phase

This is where the real work begins. OMR software commonly makes these mistakes, especially on scanned scores:

* **Rhythms and Rests:** Incorrect durations, missed dots, or tuplets (triplets, etc.) being read as regular notes.
* **Pitches:** Wrong notes, especially on ledger lines, or missed accidentals.
* **Voices:** Confusing multiple voices on a single staff (e.g., Soprano and Alto sharing a staff).
* **Text and Lyrics:** Lyrics are often misplaced, misspelled, or recognized as dynamic markings.
* **Dynamics and Articulations:** Slurs, staccatos, accents, and hairpins are frequently missed or incorrect.

When you import the MusicXML into your notation software (e.g., the free **MuseScore**):

1.  **Go measure-by-measure** from the beginning, comparing every note, rest, and marking to your original PDF.
2.  **Use the playback** feature. Your ear will often catch a wrong note or rhythm faster than your eye.
3.  **Check the time signatures.** A common error is for the OMR to misread a time signature, which throws off all the following measures. Fix this first.
4.  **Pay close attention** to key changes, clef changes, and time signature changes, as these are common failure points.
5.  **Be patient.** For a 23-page, 8-stave score, this correction process could take several hours, but it is still significantly faster than engraving the entire piece from scratch.
