How come playing music or mastering a musical instrument seems so 'hard'?
If I start singing a simple tune I know really well like "twinkle twinkle little star" I seem to have no problems getting the basic tune out.
Even music I don't know that well, I can often sing it fairly well.
But if you ask me what notes I sung, I'm completely stuck!
If you ask me to play simple tunes I will often struggle.
But why?
Its as if I know how to say something (in english) but I have no idea how to write the words I've used down or spell them.
Can you help me to understand what is going on here?
Are there any good theories or literature on this difficulty or effective strategies in overcoming it?
It would be great to be able to just sit down at the piano and be very confident that I can play anything I can sing or the even the music I seem to be able to hear so clearly in my head.
