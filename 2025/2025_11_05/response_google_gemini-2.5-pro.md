This is a fantastic question, and your analogy is **perfect**.

> "It's as if I know how to say something (in english) but I have no idea how to write the words I've used down or spell them."

This isn't just a good analogy; it is *exactly* what is happening in your brain. You have identified the core of the challenge, which is rooted in different types of memory and skill.

Here is a breakdown of what's going on, the theories behind it, and the strategies to overcome it.

### 1. Why It's So Hard: Speaking vs. Spelling

What you are experiencing is the difference between an **intuitive, procedural skill** (singing) and an **analytical, declarative skill** (naming notes or playing an instrument).

* **Singing is like Speaking:** You have been using your vocal cords since the day you were born. Singing "Twinkle Twinkle" uses a motor skill you've already mastered (controlling your voice) to repeat a pattern you've heard countless times. This is **procedural memory**, or "knowing *how*." It's automatic, like riding a bike. You don't think about *how* to form the words; you just do it.

* **Playing/Naming Notes is like Writing/Spelling:** This requires a completely different set of skills. To play that same "Twinkle Twinkle" on a piano, you must execute a complex chain of "translation":
    1.  **Aural Skill:** You hear the tune in your head. (You're great at this part!)
    2.  **Aural *Analysis*:** Your brain must unconsciously know, "The second 'twinkle' is the *same note* as the first. The 'little' goes *up* by a specific distance."
    3.  **Conceptual Translation:** This is the hard part. You have to connect that *sound* to a *concept*. "That 'up' distance is called a 'Perfect 5th'." (This is the note-naming part you get stuck on).
    4.  **Instrument Translation:** You then have to know, "On a piano, a 'Perfect 5th' up from the note 'C' is the note 'G'."
    5.  **Motor Skill:** You must then command your fingers—which are *not* as well-trained as your voice—to find and press those specific keys.

Singing only requires Step 1 and an existing motor skill. Playing by ear requires you to master all five steps in real-time. You're not just "playing"; you're hearing, analyzing, translating, and executing all at once.

### 2. Theories and Literature on This Difficulty

You asked for theories, and the most important one for you is **Audiation**.

This term was coined by Edwin E. Gordon, a prominent music researcher. He defined **audiation** as "to music what thought is to language."

* **What it is:** Audiation is the ability to hear and comprehend music in your mind *even when no sound is present*. That "music I seem to be able to hear so clearly in my head"? **That is audiation.** You already have this crucial skill.
* **The Problem:** Your "audiation" skill is currently disconnected from your "instrument" skill. The challenge isn't that you can't *hear* it; it's that you haven't yet built the mental bridge to *translate* that internal hearing into a specific physical action on an instrument.
* **The Goal:** All music education, particularly "ear training," is simply the process of building and automating that bridge. You are learning to "spell" the "words" you can already "speak."

### 3. Effective Strategies to Bridge the Gap

Your goal—to sit down and play what you hear—is the dream of "playing by ear," and it is **100% a learnable skill.** It just takes practice, like learning to write.

Here are the most effective strategies, starting from the very beginning.

#### Strategy 1: The "Sing-and-Find" Method (The Core Loop)

This is the most direct way to build the bridge. Do this for 10 minutes every day.

1.  Sit at the piano.
2.  Sing the *first note* of "Twinkle Twinkle" ("Twin-"). Hold that note.
3.  Now, "hunt and peck" on the piano keys until you find the *one key* that matches the note you are singing.
4.  Success! Now sing the *second note* ("-kle"). Hold it.
5.  Hunt and peck for that matching note. (You'll notice it's the same key).
6.  Sing the *third note* ("lit-"). Hold it.
7.  Hunt and peck for *that* note. (You'll find it's a new note, a bit higher).

This process creates a powerful feedback loop. You are directly training your brain to connect **Your Voice (Ear) -> The Instrument (Hand)**. It will be slow and frustrating at first, but it is the single most important exercise you can do.

#### Strategy 2: Learn Solfège (The "Spelling System")

You know "Twinkle Twinkle." In the language of solfège (or "sol-fa"), that song is:

**Do-Do Sol-Sol La-La Sol**
(Twinkle Twinkle Little Star)

**Fa-Fa Mi-Mi Re-Re Do**
(How I Wonder What You Are)

Solfège (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti) is a game-changer because it gives a *name* to a note's *function and sound*.

* It doesn't matter if you start on C, F, or G#. The *pattern* of "Do-Do Sol-Sol" is *always* "Twinkle Twinkle."
* Learning this system is like learning the alphabet. It's the set of "letters" you need to "spell" your "words."

#### Strategy 3: Learn Your "Spelling Rules" (Basic Theory)

You can't "spell" without knowing the alphabet and basic grammar. In music, this means:

* **Learn the Major Scale:** This is your "alphabet" in order. Practice playing it (e.g., the C major scale, all the white keys from C to C). Then practice *singing* it: "Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do." Once you know this "shape" and "sound," you'll be amazed at how many melodies are built from it.
* **Learn Basic Chords (I, IV, V):** Most simple songs (like "Twinkle Twinkle") are built on just three chords. Learning these "punctuation marks" helps you understand the musical "sentences" you're hearing.

What you're feeling is not a lack of talent; it's the very normal and predictable gap between two different skill sets. You've already mastered the hard part: *hearing* the music. Now you just need to practice the "spelling."
