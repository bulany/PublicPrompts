Rewatching George Lucas' 1977 Star Wars film is a real pleasure.
It's still a very watchable movie and the special effects don't even seem that dated.
After also seeing a 1977 mini documentary about the success of the film and some behind the scenes footage I'm really surprised that maybe the film was potentially conceived without even a sequel planned... although I guess it does say at the beginning "episode IV" right?
How did Lucas do it?
Can you give me a timeline of the important events mainly surrounding the development of the first 3 films and Lucas's career up to that point?
Like in "A New Hope" they breifly see Jabba the Hutt who wouldn't appear again until many years later in the 3rd film, and somehow the story all holds together.
Plus the story seems so universal and relatable even though it is set in space between worlds.
Did George Lucas have a model of an epic tale that he borrowed from?
Did he wrote and concieve most of the story?
Why would he have bothered creating such a rich and detailed world if he thought that maybe he would only shoot one film?
I really feel like the first film was made in a time where it wasn't common to have sequels and trilogies and 'franchises'... did Lucas pave the way a bit with all that.
Now it seems you could definitely model your own multi part epic because you have that Stars Wars example to look at... but how did Lucas do it "in the dark"?
I guess my real question is "how much work did it take to get that first film in place"? Like was it just a routine "whip up a script and get it out" and it just happened to be a wild success or did a lot more work and thought go into development?
The world seems as rich as something like Tolkiens Lord of the Rings... and you can understand good films coming out of that story because you have a rich material to work with... but Star Wars... where did it come from?
