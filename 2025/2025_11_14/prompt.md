Is there a really reliable way to monitor a persons breathing and heartrate?
Are there any low cost, open source solutions?
What are the most commonly used solutions?
I guess I'm thinking 'sleep monitoring' style apps on smartphones must have solved this problem.
Is there some kind of arduino DIY solution that's really good?
Or is it actually easier than that... just monitoring a microphone?
I would be looking for something that can monitor a single person for a whole day and basically give the data of:
timestamp: inhale started
timestamp: exhale started
timestamp: inhale started etc

and also something similar for heartbeat... what are the commonly used data formats for this application?
Really I'm wondering if there is something like a breathing and heartbeat "pedometer" that people can easily see how many breaths they took over say the last 24 hour period.
