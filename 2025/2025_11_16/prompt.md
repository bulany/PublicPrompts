I have a switch mode power supply for my laptop that I unfortunately dropped on a concrete floor and now it doesn't work any more. 
It has "45W GAN" written on the side.
What do you know about this kind of power supply and how does it work?
Do you think there are any kind of interesting or valuable components inside that I might be able to use in other projects or potentially repair it.
It seems a shame to just throw it in the bin.
