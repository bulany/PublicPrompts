Can you tell me everything I might need to know about "A Rake's progress"? 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rake%27s_Progress)
Like who painted or drew it and why?
I'm particularly interested in trying to understand the context around it at the time.
Like was it painted by someone from an upper or lower class?
Who was its target audience?
Where was it "published"?
What was its inspiration and effect?
Also if you had to make a present day version of it, what would it look like?
The name seems really strange also... I would love you to explain that too.
