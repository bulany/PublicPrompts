"A Rake's Progress" is one of the most famous series of images in British art history. It is essentially an 18th-century "comic strip" or storyboard—a visual narrative told across eight separate scenes.

Here is the breakdown of everything you need to know about it, the context, and that strange name.

### 1. Who painted it and why?
* **The Artist:** It was created by **William Hogarth**, an English painter and printmaker, between **1732 and 1734**.
* **The Why:** Hogarth was an entrepreneur as much as an artist. He invented a genre he called "Modern Moral Subjects." He wanted to create art that told a story (which he called "dumb shows") that was entertaining, easy to understand, and carried a strong moral warning.
* **The Story:** It follows a character named **Tom Rakewell** who inherits a fortune from his miserly father, blows it all on luxury, gambling, and prostitution, gets thrown into debtors' prison, and finally goes insane and dies in Bedlam (the asylum).

### 2. The Context: Class, Audience, and "Publication"
* **Was Hogarth upper or lower class?**
    Hogarth was **lower-middle class**. He was not a wealthy aristocrat. In fact, his own father had been imprisoned for debt (a "debtors' prison"), which was a traumatizing event for the young Hogarth. This is why the scenes of the prison in *A Rake's Progress* are so gritty and realistic—he had lived through the shame of it personally.
* **Target Audience:**
    Unlike most art at the time, which was painted for one rich patron to hang in a mansion, Hogarth intended these for **the public**.
    He painted the original canvases, but the *real* product was the **engravings** (prints) he made from them. These were mass-produced and sold for a price that middle-class merchants and shopkeepers could afford.
* **Where was it "published"?**
    It wasn't published in a book or magazine. You would subscribe to buy the set of 8 loose prints. Hogarth actually delayed the release until June 1735 so he could get a law passed—**"Hogarth's Act"** (the first artistic copyright law)—to stop people from stealing his designs and selling cheap knock-offs.

### 3. The Name: What is a "Rake"?
The name "Rake" is short for **"Rakehell"**.
* **Literal meaning:** Someone who would "rake through the fires of hell" to find their fun.
* **18th Century meaning:** It described a very specific type of man—usually wealthy, fashionable, and addicted to immoral pleasure (gambling, drinking, womanizing). A "Rake" was a wasted life.
* **The Title:** "A Rake's Progress" is ironic. Usually, a "progress" implies moving forward or upward (like a Royal Progress). Here, his "progress" is a downward spiral into madness.

### 4. Inspiration and Effect
* **Inspiration:** London was booming with "new money" (merchants getting rich) and Hogarth saw people trying to buy their way into the upper class without having the taste or morals to handle it. He wanted to mock their stupidity.
* **Effect:** It was a massive hit. It effectively invented the idea of **social satire** in visual art. It influenced everything from political cartoons to modern cinema (filmmakers have called Hogarth the grandfather of the storyboard). Stravinsky even wrote an opera based on it.

### 5. What would a present-day version look like?
If you were to update *A Rake's Progress* for 2025, the themes of "sudden wealth" and "desperate need for validation" would remain, but the setting would change:

* **The Protagonist:** A "Crypto Bro," a sudden Lottery Winner, or an overnight TikTok Influencer.
* **Scene 1 (The Inheritance):** He checks his phone to see his crypto wallet has hit $10 million. He immediately quits his job and ghosts his modest girlfriend (the modern Sarah Young).
* **Scene 2 (The Levee):** Instead of fencing masters, he is surrounded by "hangers-on": a shady financial advisor, a personal brand consultant, and a stylist dressing him in Balenciaga.
* **Scene 3 (The Orgy):** A VIP table at a club in Dubai or Las Vegas. He is buying $10,000 champagne bottles for people who don't actually like him.
* **Scene 4 (The Arrest):** The market crashes or the IRS freezes his assets. He is narrowly bailed out by the ex-girlfriend he dumped.
* **Scene 5 (The Marriage):** He tries to marry an older, wealthy reality TV star to stay relevant and solvent.
* **Scene 6 (The Gaming House):** He is addicted to sports betting apps or high-risk day trading, staring at multiple monitors in a dark room, losing the last of his money.
* **Scene 7 (The Prison):** He is canceled online, sued for fraud, and perhaps ends up in a white-collar detention center or under house arrest with an ankle monitor.
* **Scene 8 (The Madhouse):** A luxury "wellness rehab" center. He sits alone in a robe, staring at a phone that has no signal, completely disconnected from reality, while tourists (internet trolls) mock his old posts online.
