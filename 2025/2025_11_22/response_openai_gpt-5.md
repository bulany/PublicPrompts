Great question! *A Rake’s Progress* is a rich work, layered with social, moral, and historical meaning. Here’s a breakdown of what you might want to know — and some thoughts on how to translate it into a modern version.

---

## What Is *A Rake’s Progress* — Basic Facts

1. **Artist**: William Hogarth, an English painter and printmaker. ([TheCollector][1])
2. **When**: The original paintings were made around **1732–1734**, then engraved and published in print form in **1735**. ([Wikipedia][2])
3. **Format**: It’s a *series* — eight paintings, and matching engravings. ([Wikipedia][2])
4. **Where Now**: The original paintings are in the **Sir John Soane’s Museum** in London. ([Wikipedia][2])

## What Happens in the Story — Narrative Arc

* The protagonist is **Tom Rakewell**, the spendthrift heir of a rich merchant. ([Wikipedia][2])
* He inherits a fortune, moves to London, and lives a very indulgent life — gambling, prostitution, lavish company. ([Wikipedia][3])
* Eventually, he’s arrested (for debt) and lands in **Fleet Prison**. ([Wikipedia][2])
* Finally, he ends up in **Bedlam**, the infamous mental asylum (Bethlem Hospital). ([resources.saylor.org][4])
* There’s moral commentary: Hogarth warns about the “wages of sin” — you can see it as a cautionary tale. ([Phaidon][5])

---

## Why Did Hogarth Do This? What Was His Motivation / Context

* **Moral Satire**: Hogarth coined a new kind of “modern moral subject” — telling a moral story through contemporary, everyday scenes. ([collections.soane.org][6])
* **Audience Engagement**: People in his time recognized the settings, characters, and social types. ([The Guardian][7])
* **Print Culture**: By turning them into engravings, the works could be distributed much more widely than just an aristocratic painting. ([Hood Museum][8])
* **Copyright / Piracy Concern**: Hogarth delayed the publication of the engravings until after the 1735 Copyright Act (“Hogarth’s Act”), to try to prevent piracy of his designs. ([collections.soane.org][6])

---

## Social Context — Class, Society, and Who Hogarth Was

* **Hogarth himself**: Born into a **lower-middle-class** family in London. ([www.wikiart.org][9])
* **Tom Rakewell’s Class**: He’s newly wealthy — an heir to a merchant fortune. So he’s not nobility but belongs to the rising bourgeois / mercantile class. ([TheCollector][1])
* **Target Audience**: Likely broad: not just the elite — thanks to prints, even middle-class viewers could access and understand the satire. Also, the moral message would have resonated across classes. ([Hood Museum][8])
* **Satirical Commentary**: Hogarth skewers not just “low vices,” but upper-middle-class pretension: the social climbers, the flatters, the nouveau riche pretending to aristocratic behavior. ([TheCollector][1])

---

## Inspiration & Influence

* Hogarth was influenced by **theatrical storytelling** and narrative art: he saw his series like a “moral play” in pictures. ([Phaidon][5])
* He had precedent: in his earlier series *A Harlot’s Progress*, he already explored moral themes. ([Wikipedia][10])
* The title and concept draw on a literary / cultural archetype: the “rake” — a dissolute, immoral man. ([digitens.org][11])
* The work’s impact: It became very well known; the prints were widely acquired. It has inspired many later works — e.g., Stravinsky’s opera *The Rake’s Progress*. ([Wikipedia][12])

---

## Understanding “Rake” — Why That Title?

* **Etymology / Meaning**: In the 18th-century British context, a “rake” (short for *rake-hell*) meant someone morally loose: gambler, libertine, womanizer. ([digitens.org][11])
* So *A Rake’s Progress* essentially means: the journey / downfall of a dissolute young man.
* It’s a play on words: rake = libertine, but also suggests “raking in” money (since Tom inherits from his miser father). Some interpretations point that double meaning. ([Wikipedia][13])

---

## Effects & Legacy

* The series helped to popularize **moralizing pictorial narratives** — combining art and storytelling in a way that was broadly accessible. ([collections.soane.org][6])
* It influenced popular culture deeply: not only in art, but in music (opera), ballet, later visual art. ([Wikipedia][14])
* It also contributed to what we now call “Hogarthian” satire — sharp social critique, dark humor, moral lessons. ([www.wikiart.org][9])
* It reinforced social anxieties of the time: the dangers of wasteful wealth, gambling, hedonism, and debt.

## If You Made a **Present-Day Version**

Here’s a creative thought exercise: how *would* I translate *A Rake’s Progress* into a modern-day form?

* **Modern Protagonist**: Instead of Tom Rakewell, maybe a young tech-bro or startup heir who inherits wealth or gets a big investment.
* **Settings**:

  * First, he inherits → a slick co-working loft or Manhattan / Silicon Valley pad.
  * Then, he throws “levées”: networking brunches, influencer meetups, private jets.
  * He gambles / wastes money: crypto speculation, high-stakes poker, crypto casinos, parties in Ibiza or Vegas.
  * Prostitution or “vice”: could be replaced with high-end nightlife, escort culture, “sugar baby” dynamics.
  * Arrest / debt: credit card debt, lawsuits, bankruptcy.
  * Madness / breakdown: mental health crisis, maybe rehab or a modern psychiatric ward.
* **Medium**:

  * Could be a graphic novel, a streaming miniseries, or even a social media thread / webcomic.
  * Use serialized “episodes” (like Hogarth’s plates) — each scene is a chapter.
* **Tone / Style**: Satirical, visually detailed, full of Easter eggs referencing modern life (Bitcoin logos, brand names, influencer archetypes).
* **Moral Message**: Critique of consumerism, inequality, the cult of “hustle culture,” and how easy it is to self-destruct when you’re chasing status.

---

## Why It’s Strange / Brilliant

* The **name** (“A Rake’s Progress”) seems odd at first because “rake” is not a common modern word, and “progress” in this sense is ironic: it’s not progress in a good way — it’s his downfall.
* But it’s brilliant because:

  * It captures the *cultural archetype* of a libertine.
  * It promises a journey — not upward, but morally downward.
  * It feels like a moral fable, but dramatized through real-life London scenes of Hogarth’s time.
