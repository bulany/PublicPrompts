Can you tell me everything you think I might need to know about the concept of "Aura Farming"?
Like what is the timeline of the term and what are the most famous examples?
Could you point to any examples of similar phenomenon in the pre internet era or in much earlier times?
Has anyone ever made a joke along the lines of "Aura Farming... well how about ethical Aura Farming? I'm an organic Aura Farmer" etc?
If you were going to make this joke as part of a stand up routine how might you approach it?
