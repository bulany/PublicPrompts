Ok I'm pretty ok with straight html, css and javascript, and how they are served to the browser, but how does a Progressive Web App differ to this?
Could you give me a timeline on how PWA developed and what kind of technology they rely on.
I guess I'm interested in the timeline because I want to know if this was a w3 consortium initiative or was it a particular browser vendor that thought this was a good idea and then everyone decided to support it?
Like what are the main differences between a PWA and a standard web page? 
What are the essential files you have to have and what do they do?
What is a service worker and why do you need one?
Please try and help my understanding... if I had my video annotation app and I wanted it to work offline and I wanted to add a new video after a week and not really change the source code... well if it was a little server hosted on my desktop computer then the app could handle this easily by looking in the static assets or public dir and serving out any files there... but if I want this to work on my iphone it has to be different right?
Does the PWA have its own little file system inside the browser?
And then its like the content has to be served one time (e.g. if you are updating with new files) and then it kind of keeps those virtual files in its cache?
Does the PWA check each time if its connected to the internet and if its not it sees if it can make do with what is in its cache? How does one manage this cache?
Hmmm I'm struggling with this... I would love to know how it works a little more. Maybe you could illustrate with some really minimal examples of PWAs. 
And maybe you could tell me about the limitations of PWAs - like when would some other architecture be more appropriate?
