Ok but I guess where Capacitor falls down is if say I wanted to share the app rapidly with a few friends for testing (like get the app onto their iPhones also... I guess its not as easy as just sending them a link?).
Can you think of any easy ways to do this... I guess the PWA approach is best for this?
Are there any other approaches I should consider?
