You mentioned terms like SRS, FSRS, Leitner, SM-2, "short loop", scaffolding and "immediate correction for discrimintive learning".
Could you demystify these terms for me a bit and maybe show me where they come from and how they relate to the research field of "deliberate practice"?
And I've had so more thoughts about the learning goals of the game influenced a little by the insights you provided.
I think I want the real "goal" of the game to be the following:
That a player of the game can, very quickly, efficiently and hopefully having a bit of fun along the way learn the following skill: be able to click each department of France on a map with the department outlines in order in a regular rhythm. A bit similar to how I am able to very easily count from 1 to 100 at a pretty rapid and regular tempo... and its a very relaxed and "easy" affair... the tempo could basically be as quickly as I can say the numbers comfortably and understandably... and I never have to stop and struggle to think which number comes next, I just "know"... I could do this easily backwards from 100 to 1 if I wanted to as well.
The reason I'm keen on the rhythm / tempo part of it is that I find that if I don't know something well I'm not able to perform or recall it at a tempo... like I might be able to play the first few notes of a melody but then start to fumble a few notes in... and then fumbling I think is partly due to my attention wandering but also the fact that I just don't know the note sequence as well as I know the sequence of numbers 1 to 100 (or the alphabet A..Z)... when I recite the alphabet I probably still have the song I learned as a child running in my head (which keeps the letters flowing at a certain rhythm). 
Do Edwin Gordon's music learning theories coincide with any of the techniques you mentioned or what I just described?
I wondered that especially when I heard you use the term "discriminative learning".
I have observed with myself that when I hear a melody, even one that I can't play, I can easily pick out if it is being played "wrong" (either the rhythm or the notes), but if you asked me to play it I would make a lot of mistakes... why is that? Why can I so easily pick when something is wrong but not be able to perform it correctly?
So based on all this would you have any suggestions for changing the game play or level unlocks (chunking) strategy? 
Maybe the levels should just be based on 10 departments (in sequence) at a time (e.g. level 1: departments 1-10, level 2: 2A-30, etc)... is there anything in the literture that suggests an optimum number for chunking a sequence of this length (like should it be "Level 1: master the first 5 departments").
If there was a "song of the departments" maybe the task would be as simple as learning that song? But then I would have to know what is the most efficient and fun way to learn / teach a song.
Finally, and this is important... I know you mentioned it would be a bad idea to just let the user play on the whole unlocked map right from the start, but I think it would actually be really fun to have some mode where we can get a benchmark of people's progress. Like they get to play a round of some kind of game first (maybe its a test where it runs through all the departments in a random order and you just get one guess at each and then there is a score)... and that would be great to first get a baseline of what peoples knowledge is like at the start (before they start playing the learning game)... and then maybe after a week they can retest themselves and hopefully see some progress at least on the part that they have studied. And I guess I'm hoping that would provide a really positive motivation ("wow, this is really working, I can I see that if I put in a consistent effort I'm going to be able to do this no problems")... it would be also awesome to be able to demonstrate: "look I went from playing like this 4 weeks ago to playing like this now - and I had fun doing it!"
I think it would also be interesting and fun to see the baselines of French natives and non-French natives etc or like even if it could be a little "dinner party game" of like "ok, let's see amongst this group who know's their departments best"... then maybe if the friends meet for dinner again in a few weeks and some of them have played the game they can have fun playing again and showing each other their progress.
