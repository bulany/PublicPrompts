So I want to buy the following cables on the internet:
5 x iphone to old usb cables
5 x iphone to usb c cables
3 x old usb to usb c adapters (the one with a little cable so it doesn't stress my usb c ports)
3 x iphone to headphone jack cables
3 x 3.5mm jack to 3.5mm jack cable - I want to replace a nice one I had that had a socket on one of the cables so you could plug in an extra pair of headphones and share sound
1 x 45W Gan usb charger that will work to charge my laptop
I'm convinced that all these things will be a lot cheaper to buy from Ali Express than in an actual shop.
I have successfully ordered and had delivered (to France) some things from Ali Express before but I found the experience of trying to choose the right one frustrated.
I have more experience buying these kinds of things on ebay where I find a trusted seller who has sold a lot of the product with very good reviews and I just buy from them.
I imagine shopping on Amazon would also be a bit easier.
But could you give me some tips to make my experience on AliExpress better? Like how I could quickly find a reputable seller of the product I want etc
Eventually I would also like to buy very small quantites of electronics components also e.g. like 5 x RGB LEDs, maybe some little microcontrollers... do you have any tips for buying these kinds of things online?
