# Tips for Shopping on AliExpress

## Finding Reputable Sellers Quickly

**Use AliExpress's built-in filters strategically:**
- Sort by "Orders" rather than just price - this shows you what other people are actually buying
- Enable "4+ star items only" in the filters
- Look for the "Choice" badge - these are curated products that AliExpress has verified for quality and reliable shipping
- Filter by "Free shipping" to avoid surprise costs

**Quick seller credibility check:**
- Click into a listing and scroll to the store rating section
- Look for: 95%+ positive feedback, thousands of sales, and ideally the store has been open 2+ years
- Check the "Seller Ratings" tab - pay special attention to "Item as Described" and "Communication" scores
- Read recent reviews with photos - these are gold for seeing what actually arrives

**Smart search techniques:**
- Search for your item, then immediately add your country (e.g., "USB C cable France") - this often surfaces sellers who ship reliably to your region
- Use AliExpress's "Similar items" feature once you find one decent product - it clusters similar quality items together

## Specific Tips for Your Shopping List

**For cables and chargers:**
- Prioritize listings with actual product testing photos in reviews (voltage testers, data transfer screenshots)
- For the 45W GaN charger: search "45W GaN PD charger" and verify in the specs it lists your laptop's charging standard (USB-C PD is most common)
- The headphone splitter cable you want is often called a "3.5mm Y splitter cable" or "audio sharing cable"

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Suspiciously low prices compared to similar items (often fake specs)
- Generic product photos with no branding
- Lots of 5-star reviews but all posted within a few days (purchased reviews)
- Vague product descriptions with poor English that don't specify standards (USB 2.0 vs 3.0, etc.)

## For Electronics Components (LEDs, Microcontrollers)

**Better sources than AliExpress for small quantities:**
- **LCSC.com** - Chinese component supplier with reasonable international shipping, excellent for small quantities, very reliable
- **Mouser** or **DigiKey** (if you need it fast) - they ship to France, though more expensive per component
- **AliExpress can work** but buy from stores that specialize in components (look for stores with "electronics," "DIY," or "maker" in their name)

**For components on AliExpress:**
- Buy slightly more than you need (e.g., order 10 LEDs if you need 5) - some may be DOA
- Search for complete kits if you're experimenting - often better value and curated selection
- Check component datasheets if provided - legitimate sellers include these

## General AliExpress Wisdom

**Shipping expectations:**
- "AliExpress Standard Shipping" is usually the sweet spot for speed vs. cost to France (2-3 weeks typically)
- Avoid "free shipping" options that take 60+ days unless you're very patient
- Track packages through the AliExpress app, not through random tracking websites

**Dispute protection:**
- AliExpress buyer protection is quite good if items don't arrive or are significantly wrong
- Take photos/videos of anything defective before requesting a refund
- Open disputes within the protection period (it's usually 60-90 days)

**Money-saving approach:**
- Add items to cart but don't buy immediately - wait for sale events (11.11, Black Friday, etc.) when many sellers offer 10-30% off
- For your cable order, you might save €10-15 by waiting a few weeks if there's a sale coming up
