Shopping on AliExpress can be overwhelming because of the sheer volume of items, but for cables and small electronics, it is indeed much cheaper and often the exact same product you’d find on Amazon (just without the 2-day delivery markup).

Here is a structured guide to finding the best quality items for your list and avoiding the "junk" listings.

### **Part 1: The "Golden Rules" for a Better Experience**

To avoid frustration and months of waiting, follow these three rules for every search:

1.  **Filter by "Choice" or "Plus":**
    * **Choice:** These items are shipped directly by AliExpress (not the individual seller). They usually come in **one combined package**, have faster delivery (often 10-12 days to France), and reliable tracking. This is critical for buying 20+ small items like cables so they don't arrive in 20 separate envelopes over 3 months.
2.  **Stick to "Official Stores" or Top Brands:**
    * For cables and chargers, do not buy unbranded generic items. The quality difference is massive. Stick to **Ugreen, Baseus, Anker,** or **Essager**. They have "Official Stores" on AliExpress.
3.  **Check the "Feedback" Score:**
    * Look for a store rating of **95% or higher**.
    * Look for the item to have **100+ orders** and photo reviews.

### **Part 2: Your Shopping List Strategy**

Here is exactly how to search for each item on your list to get the best quality-to-price ratio.

#### **1. The Cables (iPhone & USB-C)**
* **Search Terms:** `MFi lightning cable` (for iPhone) and `USB C cable 60W`.
* **Recommended Brands:** **Ugreen** or **Baseus**.
* **Tip:** For the iPhone cables, look for "MFi Certified" (Made for iPhone) in the title. Non-certified ones might stop working after an iOS update.
* **Buying Tip:** These brands often sell "packs" (e.g., a 2-pack or 3-pack). Buying 2 packs is often cheaper than 5 single cables.

#### **2. Old USB to USB-C Adapters (Flexible type)**
* **The Problem:** Most adapters are rigid little blocks that stick out and can snap your port if bumped.
* **The Solution:** You want an "OTG Cable" style or "Extension" style.
* **Search Terms:** `USB C to USB 3.0 adapter cable` or `USB C OTG cable`.
* **What to look for:** A picture showing a short (10-15cm) cable between the male USB-C plug and the female USB-A socket. **Ugreen** makes a very popular grey braided one.

#### **3. iPhone to Headphone Jack**
* **Search Terms:** `Lightning to 3.5mm adapter`.
* **Crucial Detail:** Again, look for "MFi certified" or a top brand like **Ugreen**. The cheap $1 ones often have terrible "DACs" (digital-to-analog converters) that make your music sound like it's playing through a tin can, or they break in a week.

#### **4. 3.5mm Jack Splitter (The "Nice One")**
* **Your description:** "Socket on one of the cables."
* **Interpretation:** You likely had a high-quality "Y-Splitter" where the splitter block wasn't a rigid plastic chunk but a flexible cable junction.
* **Search Terms:** `3.5mm audio splitter cable 1 male 2 female` or `headphone splitter cable nylon`.
* **Recommendation:** Look for the brand **Vention** or **Ugreen**. They make splitters with nice aluminum casings and braided nylon cables that feel premium and don't tangle.
    * *Note:* Ensure you choose the "Headphone + Headphone" version, not "Headphone + Microphone" (which splits audio and mic). The diagram on the listing usually shows two headphone icons.

#### **5. 45W GaN Charger**
* **Search Terms:** `GaN charger 45W` or `GaN charger 65W` (65W is often similar in price and more versatile).
* **Safety Warning:** Do **not** buy a generic unbranded charger for your laptop. It’s a fire risk.
* **Go-To Brands:** **Baseus** (very popular for GaN chargers), **Ugreen**, or **Anker**.
* **Plug Type:** Make sure you select the "EU Plug" option (the round pins for France) before adding to cart, as the default is often US.

### **Part 3: Buying Electronics Components (LEDs, Micros)**

This is a different ballgame. The "Choice" shipping often doesn't apply to tiny 50-cent bags of LEDs, so shipping can be slow unless you consolidate.

* **The Strategy:** Buy everything from **one big hobbyist store** to pay for shipping once (or get free shipping threshold).
* **Reputable Stores for Hobbyists:**
    1.  **"DIY Electronic Kit Store"** or **"TZT"**: Huge inventory of sensors, LEDs, and modules.
    2.  **"Wemos" (or LOLIN) Official Store**: The absolute best place for ESP32/ESP8266 microcontrollers.
    3.  **"RobotDyn"**: Known for slightly higher quality, black PCB components that look professional.
* **Tip:** For generic parts (LEDs, resistors), AliExpress is fine. For complex chips (like a specific STM32 microcontroller), AliExpress sellers sometimes sell "clones" or fake chips. If you need 100% reliability for a complex project, use a distributor like **LCSC** (cheaper than Digikey/Mouser but slower) or **Tayda Electronics**.

### **Summary of Next Steps**

1.  **Download the App:** The AliExpress app often has slightly lower prices ("Coins" discount) than the desktop site.
2.  **Cart Building:** Add all your Ugreen/Baseus cables and chargers first. Try to get them all from the **same official store** (e.g., everything from Ugreen Official Store) to ensure they come in one box.
3.  **Filter:** Toggle the **"Choice"** switch at the top of your search results to see items that will definitely arrive quickly to France.
