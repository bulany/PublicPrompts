Is there any easy and built in way to record audio on an iphone while one has some other audio playing?
Like for example if I could play a backing track and then while this backing track is playing record some other audio over the top of it.
Can you describe the basic technical difficulties of this scenario.
Like if I have two iphones, the problems is immediately simplfied: I play audio one one device and record it on the other using the built in voice recorder app.
Is the situation the same on Android phones or are there easy to use built in solutions?
If there are no built in solutions what would you suggest is the easiest way to achieve this kind of thing?
Before iPhones existed what were the most common and accessible tools used to achieve this task?
