There is generally no single "easy button" to do this on most smartphones for just *audio* files because of how they are designed to handle sound focus, but there are built-in workarounds and specific new features depending on your device.

### 1. The Built-in Solutions (iPhone)

For most iPhones, if you open the **Voice Memos** app and hit record, it will automatically pause any music playing from Spotify or Apple Music. However, there are two ways around this:

*   **The "Video" Workaround (Works on almost all iPhones):**
    You can record a *video* while music plays, which captures the audio.
    1.  Play your music.
    2.  Open the **Camera** app (stay in **Photo** mode, do not swipe to Video).
    3.  Hold down the shutter button (the white circle) to start recording a video.
    4.  Slide your finger to the right to "lock" the recording so you don't have to hold it.
    5.  The music will keep playing, and the microphone will record you singing/playing over it. You will end up with a video file, but you can extract the audio later or just use the video.

*   **The "Layered" Recording (New Feature - iPhone 16 Pro / iOS 18):**
    If you have a very recent Pro model running the latest iOS (18.2 or newer), Apple has added a **"Layered Recording"** feature to Voice Memos.
    1.  Record your backing track (or import it).
    2.  Tap the "Layers" icon (looks like papers stacked).
    3.  You can now record a second track over the first one natively.

### 2. Is it the same on Android?

Yes, the situation is largely the same. Android has a system called "Audio Focus." When you hit record in a voice recorder app, it "requests focus," and the system tells your music player to pause.

*   **The Workaround:** Most modern Androids have a built-in **Screen Recorder** in the Quick Settings panel (swipe down from the top).
    *   Set the sound settings to "Media and Microphone."
    *   Start screen recording, then play your music and sing/speak.
    *   This will create a video file with both the backing track (internal audio) and your voice (microphone) mixed together.

### 3. The Technical Difficulties (Why isn't this standard?)

The reason this isn't a simple default feature is a mix of hardware physics and software logic:

*   **Feedback Loops (The Physical Problem):** If the phone plays music out of its speakers while simultaneously recording with its microphone, the microphone will "hear" the music and record it again. This creates a muddy, echoing mess or a screeching feedback loop. To do this properly, you almost *always* need headphones so the microphone only hears *you*.
*   **Audio Focus (The Software Problem):** Mobile operating systems are designed to stop apps from fighting over the speakers. If you are listening to a podcast and a call comes in, you want the podcast to stop. The OS assumes that if you are recording, you need a quiet environment, so it kills the background audio.
*   **Latency (The Timing Problem):** If you record over a backing track, the phone takes a few milliseconds to process your voice. If the software doesn't automatically correct for this "latency," your recording will sound slightly out of time with the music when you play it back.

### 4. The Easiest Solutions (Third-Party Apps)

Since the built-in apps fight you on this, the "easy" way is actually to download a free app designed for **Multitrack Recording**. These apps are built to play audio and record simultaneously.

*   **GarageBand (iPhone):** It is free and built by Apple. You drag your music file into one track, create a new "Audio Recorder" track, put on headphones, and hit record. It handles all the technical issues for you.
*   **BandLab (iPhone & Android):** A very popular, free, and easy-to-use social music creation app. It works exactly like the "two phone" method but digital.
*   **Dolby On (iOS/Android):** excellent for recording high-quality video or audio with noise reduction, often allowing backing tracks.

### 5. Historical Context: How did people do this before iPhones?

Before smartphones, the "most common and accessible" tool for this was the **4-Track Cassette Recorder**, most famously the **Tascam Portastudio**.

*   **The "Portastudio" (Late 70s - 90s):** This was a device about the size of a large textbook that used standard cassette tapes.
*   **How it worked:** You could record a guitar on "Track 1." Then, you would rewind the tape, put on headphones, and while listening to Track 1, record your vocals onto "Track 2."
*   **Accessibility:** Before this, multitrack recording was only possible in massive, expensive professional studios. The Portastudio (specifically the Tascam 144, released in 1979) was the first time a regular person could layer audio at home cheaply. Bruce Springsteen notoriously recorded his entire *Nebraska* album on one of these in his bedroom.
