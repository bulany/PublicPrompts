Who holds the definitive list of "numbers to French Department names"?
I have heard of "l'insee" and the "la poste"?
What are these institutions and does one take precedence over the other - do they have differences between their lists of departments and numbers?
How about the current list of regions? Who maintains this? Can you list them out for me? Does the institution that is responsible for these maintain a kind of "order" for these? Like say is "Bretagne" always listed before "Occitanie"?
If I understand correctly there is a kind of Region - Department - prefecture hierarchy... does this heirarchy spread further in either direction? Like what is responsible for all of the Regions, and what is below the level of prefecture?
Can you give me a general overview of this whole system and how it works together and maybe a bit of the history of it?
Thanks!
