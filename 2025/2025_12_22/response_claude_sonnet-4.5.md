I'll search for current information about French administrative divisions and the institutions that maintain them.Great questions! Let me give you a comprehensive overview of the French administrative system.

## Who Maintains the Official Lists?

**INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)** is the definitive authority. INSEE maintains the Official Geographical Code (Code officiel géographique, or COG), which is the authoritative classification of all French administrative units. This includes regions, departments, communes, and even countries/territories for birth records.

**La Poste** (the French postal service) maintains postal codes, but these serve a different purpose. Postal codes identify which post office delivers mail to a location, not precise administrative boundaries. The first two digits of postal codes generally match department numbers, but there are exceptions where villages are served by post offices in neighboring departments.

**Key difference**: INSEE codes are about administrative identity and statistics; postal codes are about mail delivery logistics. INSEE takes clear precedence for official purposes—it's literally enshrined in law as reference data for the French Republic.

## Current French Regions (18 total)

**Metropolitan regions (13):**
1. Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
2. Bourgogne-Franche-Comté
3. Bretagne (Brittany)
4. Centre-Val de Loire
5. Corse (Corsica)
6. Grand Est
7. Hauts-de-France
8. Île-de-France
9. Normandie
10. Nouvelle-Aquitaine
11. Occitanie
12. Pays de la Loire
13. Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur

**Overseas regions (5):**
14. Guadeloupe
15. Guyane (French Guiana)
16. Martinique
17. Mayotte
18. La Réunion

These took their current form on January 1, 2016, when 22 metropolitan regions were reduced to 13 through mergers.

## Ordering Systems

Department numbers were originally assigned in alphabetical order when created in 1790, though subsequent name changes and territorial adjustments mean the correspondence is no longer exact. For example, "01" is Ain, "02" is Aisne, etc.

For regions, there isn't a fixed "official order" like with departments. INSEE assigns region codes, but in practice, regions are often listed either alphabetically or by their numeric codes. Bretagne would indeed typically come before Occitanie alphabetically.

## The Complete Administrative Hierarchy

From top to bottom:

**1. National Level** - The French Republic

**2. Regions (18)** - The highest administrative subdivision
- Have elected regional councils
- Responsible for high schools, regional transportation, economic development

**3. Departments (101)** - The cornerstone of the system
- 96 in metropolitan France, 5 overseas
- Each has a prefecture (capital city) and a prefect appointed by the national government
- Elected departmental councils
- Departments are subdivided into 320 arrondissements and 1,995 cantons

**4. Arrondissements (320+)** - Administrative districts
- NOT elected bodies—run by appointed sub-prefects
- The capital is called a "sous-préfecture" (sub-prefecture)
- Used for administrative organization

**5. Cantons (2,054)** - Electoral constituencies
- Not independent governing bodies
- Serve primarily as constituencies for electing departmental council members
- Each canton elects one man and one woman to the departmental council

**6. Communes (~34,000)** - The basic unit
- The smallest and oldest administrative division, dating to the 12th century
- Can be major cities like Paris or tiny villages with under 100 people
- Have elected mayors and municipal councils
- Handle births, marriages, deaths registration
- Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are further divided into municipal arrondissements (different from departmental arrondissements!)

## Historical Context

The system was created during the French Revolution in 1790 to replace the chaotic patchwork of provinces, duchies, and feudal territories of the Ancien Régime. The revolutionaries deliberately chose neutral geographical names (often rivers and mountains) rather than historical provincial names to break with the past and create a unified, rational administrative structure.

The original 83 departments expanded to 130 by 1809 during Napoleon's conquests, then contracted back after his defeat. The system has remained remarkably stable since then, with departments forming the backbone of French administration for over 200 years.

The regions are much newer—only created in 1982 and significantly reorganized in 2016. This makes France somewhat unusual in that the "middle tier" (departments) is actually older and more important than the "upper tier" (regions).

Does this help clarify the system? It's quite elegant once you understand the hierarchy!
