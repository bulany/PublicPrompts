This is a great question. You have stumbled upon a classic French administrative quirk: the difference between the **legal administration** of the territory and the **logistical delivery** of mail.

Here is the definitive breakdown of who holds the list, how the hierarchy works, and why there are two "versions" of the numbers.

### 1. Who holds the "Definitive" list? (INSEE vs. La Poste)

If you are looking for the legally binding, official list of French departments and regions, the authority is **l'INSEE** (*Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques*).

*   **INSEE:** They maintain the **COG** (*Code officiel géographique*). This is the gold standard used by the government, the census, and the administration.
*   **La Poste:** They are a company (formerly state-owned) responsible for mail. They maintain a list of **Codes Postaux** (Postal Codes).

**Do they differ? Yes.**
While they match 99% of the time, the differences are crucial. The most famous example is **Corsica**:
*   **INSEE (Legal):** In 1976, the department of Corsica (number 20) was split into two. INSEE strictly updated the list:
    *   **2A** (Corse-du-Sud)
    *   **2B** (Haute-Corse)
*   **La Poste (Logistical):** Changing zip codes is expensive and complicated for sorting machines. So, La Poste simply kept the old number **20** for all postal codes in Corsica (e.g., 20000 Ajaccio).

**Who takes precedence?**
*   If you are filling out a **legal form**, paying taxes, or looking at license plates: **INSEE** (Use 2A/2B).
*   If you are **mailing a letter**: **La Poste** (Use 20).

### 2. The Regions: The Current List & Order

The regions were significantly reformed in **2016** (reducing the number of metropolitan regions from 22 to 13).

**Who maintains this?** The State (defined by law), codified by INSEE.
**Is there an "Order"?** There is no "protocol rank" (one region is not superior to another). In official decrees and lists, they are strictly listed in **alphabetical order**.

Here is the current list (Metropolitan France):

1.  **Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes**
2.  **Bourgogne-Franche-Comté**
3.  **Bretagne**
4.  **Centre-Val de Loire**
5.  **Corse** (Technically a "Collectivity" with special status, but functions as a region)
6.  **Grand Est**
7.  **Hauts-de-France**
8.  **Île-de-France** (Paris region)
9.  **Normandie**
10. **Nouvelle-Aquitaine**
11. **Occitanie**
12. **Pays de la Loire**
13. **Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur**

*Plus the 5 Overseas Regions (DROM): Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, La Réunion, Mayotte.*

### 3. The Hierarchy: How high and low does it go?

You mentioned the **Region - Department - Prefecture** hierarchy. It actually extends further in both directions. This stacking of layers is famously called the *"Millefeuille territorial"* (Territorial Napoleon/Lasagna).

Here is the full ladder from top to bottom:

#### **A. The State (L'État)**
*   **Ministry of the Interior:** The "boss" of the administrative territory. They appoint the Prefects.

#### **B. The Region (Région)**
*   **Role:** Economic development, high schools (lycées), transport (trains).
*   **State Rep:** **Préfet de Région** (The highest state official in the area).
*   **Elected Body:** Regional Council (led by a President).

#### **C. The Department (Département)**
*   **Role:** Social welfare (allocations), middle schools (collèges), fire services.
*   **State Rep:** **Préfet de Département**. They sit in the **Préfecture** (the capital city of the department).
*   **Elected Body:** Departmental Council.

#### **D. The Arrondissement (District)**
*   **Role:** A subdivision of the department strictly for organizing the police and local administration.
*   **State Rep:** **Sous-Préfet** (Sub-prefect). They sit in a **Sous-préfecture**.
*   *Note: This level has no elected council. It is purely administrative.*

#### **E. The Canton**
*   **Role:** An electoral district. Several communes are grouped together strictly to elect representatives to the Departmental Council.

#### **F. The Commune (Municipality)**
*   **Role:** The base level. Building permits, primary schools, civil registry (births/marriages).
*   **Leader:** **Maire** (Mayor). The Mayor is unique because they are both an elected official *and* a representative of the State (officier d'état civil).

*(There is actually a relatively new layer inserted between Department and Commune called **Intercommunality** (EPCI), where groups of towns pool money for trash collection and transport, but that might complicate things too much!)*

### 4. General Overview & History

To understand *why* it is this way, you have to look at the **French Revolution (1789)**.

**The History:**
Before 1789, France was a patchwork of feudal "Provinces" (like Brittany, Burgundy) with their own weird laws and taxes. The Revolutionaries wanted to break these old loyalties and create a unified "One and Indivisible Republic."

They erased the provinces and used a ruler to slice France into roughly equal-sized chunks called **Departments**.
*   ** The Logic:** The size was calculated so that any citizen could ride a horse from their home to the Prefecture (capital), handle their business, and ride back before nightfall (about one day's travel).
*   **The Naming:** To strip away history, they named them solely after **geography** (rivers, mountains, coasts). That’s why you have *Haute-Garonne* (Upper Garonne river) or *Puy-de-Dôme* (Volcano).

**The System Today:**
For two centuries, the State (Prefect) held all the power. But since **1982 (Decentralization laws)**, power has shifted. The Prefect handles security and legality, but the **elected Presidents** of the Regions and Departments now handle the budget and decision-making for local life.

The 2016 reform merged the regions to try to make them bigger and more economically competitive on a European scale (e.g., merging Alsace, Lorraine, and Champagne into "Grand Est"), though many locals still cling to their old regional identities.
