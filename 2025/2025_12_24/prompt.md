I want to know as much as I can about the Camp Lo song "Luchini AKA This is it".
In what year was this recorded, where and by whom?
At what period in their career was the band when they recorded this song?
Who produced the beat for the song and what samples did they use?
What does "Camp Lo" mean? It seems kind of abstract...
What does "Luchini pouring from the sky" mean?
Can you try and "translate" the meaning of the song and lyrics for me? 
Along with the name of the band they seem like they use a kind of abstraction... why do they do this and what does it achieve?
