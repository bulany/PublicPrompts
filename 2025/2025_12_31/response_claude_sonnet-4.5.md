I'll create a comprehensive breathing meditation audio synthesizer for you. This will use the Web Audio API and Tone.js for audio synthesis and manipulation.I've created a breathing meditation audio synthesizer that meets your specifications! Here's what it includes:

**Key Features:**

1. **20-minute structured audio** with the exact timing you specified:
   - 20s intro
   - 3 rounds of breathing (30 breaths each in 1m30s)
   - Progressive breath holds (1m, 1m30s, 1m30s)
   - Deep inhale sections (15s each)
   - ~10m25s free meditation with circle of fifths progression

2. **Playback Controls:**
   - Play/Pause button
   - Scrubable progress bar
   - Current section display
   - Time display

3. **Custom Sound Upload:**
   - Drag & drop areas for inhale, exhale, breath hold, and vocal message sounds
   - Default synthesized sounds play immediately
   - Custom sounds replace defaults when uploaded

4. **Audio Synthesis:**
   - Breathing sounds with rising/falling tones
   - Ticking clock during breath holds
   - Ambient pad progression through circle of fifths during free meditation
   - Deep breathing sounds using noise synthesis

5. **Export:** Save as WAV button (MP3 encoding would require additional libraries, but WAV provides lossless quality)

The app works entirely client-side with no server needed. You can play and preview immediately on page load, customize with your own sounds, and export the final result!
