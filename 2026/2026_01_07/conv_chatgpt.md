Could you point me to some url's or resources I might use to verify these claims?

# Response 1
The community of **Santa Teresa** in the Northern Territory of Australia (also known by its Eastern Arrernte name **Ltyentye Apurte**) **takes its name from a Catholic saint — Saint Thérèse of Lisieux** (also known as *Saint Therese*, the “Little Flower”) rather than from Mother Teresa of Calcutta. ([ntlis.nt.gov.au][1])

### 🕊️ Who is the Saint Santa Teresa Is Named After?

* **Saint Thérèse of Lisieux** (1873–1897) was a French Carmelite nun known for her simple and profound spirituality called *“the Little Way.”* She is one of the most popular Roman Catholic saints and was canonized in 1925. ([ntlis.nt.gov.au][1])
* **Santa Teresa (the place name)** is the *Italian/Spanish form* of Thérèse. In this context, it refers to **Saint Thérèse of Lisieux**, not Mother Teresa (Saint Teresa of Calcutta). ([ntlis.nt.gov.au][1])
* According to the Northern Territory Place Names Register, the name was chosen in the early 1950s when the Catholic Church established a mission on the site, and it *specifically commemorates Saint Thérèse of Lisieux*. ([ntlis.nt.gov.au][1])
