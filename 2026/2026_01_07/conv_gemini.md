# Response 1
The community of **Santa Teresa** (also known by its Eastern Arrernte name, **Ltyentye Apurte**) is named after **Saint Thérèse of Lisieux** (1873–1897), a French Carmelite nun who is often referred to as "The Little Flower."

The mission was established in the 1950s by the Catholic Church. According to the Northern Territory Place Names Register, the church chose the name "Santa Teresa" to honor her.
