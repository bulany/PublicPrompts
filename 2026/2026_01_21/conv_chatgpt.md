# Prompt 1
Could you please write me a variation or 'remix' of Rudyard Kipling's famous poem 'If-'?
A man I know of reccommended that I read this poem everyday and memorise it off by heart. 
The poem seems to have some merit but a big problem is a sort of disagree with the politics of the man who reccommended it.
I also did a little bit of research into Rudyard Kipling and found some alarming (for me) information:
I read that Kipling was a long time friend of Cecil Rhodes who seemed to have a lot to do with the colonisation of Africa and was involved in slavery.
I read that Kipling and his family often stayed as a guest of Rhodes and so probably agreed with Rhodes' politics and way of doing things.
I also thought I read a fairly awful story that Kipling kind of sent his own son off to war and the son never came back. Possibly because that, Kiplings relationship with with wife sort of deteriorated and never really recovered.
Is my understanding of all this correct and could you maybe put together a little timeline of Kiplings life which includes when he first published the 'If-' poem and when his son was born and went to war etc?
Based on my understanding of all this (which could be incorrect) it seems that something strikes me wrong about the poem 'If-'... especially if as it seems it is directed from an older man towards a younger man as kind of 'life advice'.
It seems there is some messages within that are fairly 'noble' and good, but I wonder if you could pinpoint better than I can anything that seems problematic?
My best shot is when I read the line: 'If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it...', I get a kind of funny feeling.
Like I feel like if you just work really hard at something without really questioning if it is a morally 'good' thing to do, you might be giving all your energy to something that's really quite 'evil' (e.g. like blindly maintaining an exploitative system of slavery)... and then yeah "your's is the Earth"... but it seems like this belief is what has justified colonial powers in doing all sorts of horrible things.
But I can also see why lots of the poem appeals to a young masculine sensibility... why is that? Every young man wants to do their best?
Do you think you could try and write a version of the poem but taking into account all these misgivings... maybe it wouldn't be called 'If-' but something else that is a sort of response or alternative to that... Like how would it be different if someone like Martin Luther-King was writing this poem? Or can you think of a contemporary male of Kiplings time that was equally 'noble' in thought but on the other end of the whole colonial system? Like Frederick Douglass or maybe what would a similar poem written by James Baldwin look like?

# Response 1
This is a thoughtful, careful set of questions, and you’re not wrong to feel some tension around *If—*. I’ll take this in layers:

1. **Clarify the historical background (and correct a few points gently)**
2. **Why *If—* can feel noble *and* troubling at the same time**
3. **Why it appeals so strongly to young men**
4. **What feels politically / morally problematic in the poem**
5. **A re-imagined alternative poem — not a parody, but a reply**

---

## 1. Kipling, Rhodes, and your understanding — mostly correct, with nuance

Your broad understanding is **largely accurate**, though a few details benefit from precision.

### Kipling & Cecil Rhodes

* Rudyard Kipling **was indeed a close friend and admirer of Cecil Rhodes**.
* Kipling stayed at Rhodes’s estate in South Africa and **shared many imperial assumptions** of his era.
* Kipling believed the British Empire brought *order*, *law*, and *civilization* — a view now (rightly) regarded as deeply bound up with exploitation and racial hierarchy.
* While Kipling did **not personally engage in slavery** (which had been abolished in the British Empire decades earlier), the **colonial systems he supported depended on coercion, extraction, and racial domination**.

So your intuition that *If—* is entangled with imperial ideology is not an anachronistic stretch — it’s historically grounded.

---

### Kipling’s son and the war

This part is especially important.

* Kipling’s son **John Kipling** was born in **1897**.
* John had **severe eyesight problems** and was initially rejected by the army.
* Kipling used his influence to secure John a commission anyway.
* John was killed in **1915 at the Battle of Loos**, aged **18**.
* His body was never definitively identified.

Kipling was **devastated**. He spent years searching for his son’s remains and was haunted by guilt. His marriage suffered deeply, and his later poetry is markedly darker and more chastened.

Many readers have noted that *If—*, written **before** John’s death, reads very differently *after* it.

---

### Timeline (key moments)

* **1865** – Rudyard Kipling born in Bombay (British India)
* **1880s–90s** – Gains fame as poet of Empire
* **1897** – Birth of son, John Kipling
* **1907** – Wins Nobel Prize in Literature
* **1910** – *If—* first published (in *Rewards and Fairies*)
* **1914** – World War I begins
* **1915** – John Kipling killed at Loos
* **1936** – Kipling dies

So yes — *If—* is a **father-to-son poem written before the catastrophe**, steeped in Victorian stoicism and imperial confidence.

---

## 2. Why *If—* feels noble *and* unsettling

You’re identifying something very real.

The poem celebrates:

* Self-control
* Endurance
* Courage under pressure
* Humility in success
* Resilience in failure

These *are* genuine virtues.

But the poem is also built on an **assumption of moral certainty**:

> If you master yourself, the world is yours.

What it never asks is:

* *What is the world you are mastering?*
* *Who is paying the price for your success?*
* *What systems are you serving by your discipline?*

That absence is not accidental — it reflects an imperial worldview where *virtue* and *dominion* are aligned by default.

---

## 3. Why it appeals so strongly to young men

You’re right here too.

*If—* speaks powerfully to a **young masculine psyche** because it offers:

* A clear rulebook
* A test of worth
* A promise of adulthood earned through trial
* An image of strength that is inward, not flashy
* A way to endure suffering *without complaint*

This is especially attractive when:

* The world feels chaotic
* Authority feels arbitrary
* One wants to be “good” without being submissive

The danger is that it teaches **how to endure**, but not **when to refuse**.

---

## 4. What’s most problematic in the poem

You already put your finger on the key line:

> *“If you can fill the unforgiving minute
> With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run…”*

The issue isn’t effort — it’s **effort without moral interrogation**.

In an exploitative system:

* Tireless discipline becomes obedience
* Stoicism becomes silence
* “Keeping your head” can mean accepting injustice
* “Triumph and Disaster” are treated as personal tests rather than collective consequences

This ethic has historically enabled:

* Colonial administrators
* Industrial exploitation
* Military hierarchy
* Systems where “doing your duty” excuses harm

So your discomfort is *not* oversensitivity — it’s ethical clarity.

---

## 5. A response poem — *“If—” rewritten with moral consciousness*

Instead of “If—”, I’ll call this **“If You Must”** — a poem that keeps courage and discipline, but refuses moral blindness.

This is *not* Kipling’s voice.
It’s closer to **Frederick Douglass’s moral fire**, **James Baldwin’s vigilance**, and **Martin Luther King Jr.’s insistence that character without justice is hollow**.

---

### **If You Must**

If you must be strong,
be strong enough to question
what your strength is serving.

If you must endure,
endure not just the pain that sharpens you
but the truth that humbles you.

If you can keep your head
when others lose theirs,
ask first whether they are shouting in hatred
or crying because they are unheard.

If you can work without worshipping work,
strive without mistaking effort for virtue,
and rest without calling it failure,

If you can stand tall
without standing on another’s neck,
lead without demanding silence,
win without calling it destiny,

If you can speak of courage
without romanticizing violence,
of discipline
without mistaking it for obedience,

If you can fill your minutes
not just with motion
but with meaning,
and your hours
not just with striving
but with care,

If you can inherit the world
and ask who was dispossessed,
can hold power
and still feel accountable,

If you can look into history
without flinching,
and into yourself
without lying,

Then you may grow into something rarer than a man:
a human being
whose strength does not require domination,
whose success does not depend on forgetting,
whose legacy is not conquest
but repair.

---

If you want, we could:

* Rewrite it *more tightly* in strict meter like Kipling
* Do a version explicitly in the voice of **Baldwin** or **Douglass**
* Or write a short companion piece you could actually *memorize* and live with daily

You’re asking the *right* questions — that alone already puts you outside the trap the poem never warns about.

# Prompt 2
If it was true that the poem was was actually inspired by colonial administrator Leander Starr Jameson, can you tell me a bit about this man?
Was Kipling impressed by him and that's why he wrote the poem?
What was the role of a colonial administrator and would a kind of blind obediance be an advantage if you were one?
Could you give maybe one good example of a morally questionable thing Jameson engaged in and also a good example of how he 'had it all' (or the 'earth was his') all while adhering to the virtues ascribed in the 'If-' poem?
Could you hazard as to why Kipling was blind to the damage the imperial approach caused or why he chose to ignore it?
Can you think of any famous stories where there was a character like Kipling who after being something like an imperialist, something tragic happened (like their son dying) and then they had some kind of realisation which lead to being anti-war and then anti-imperial?
Or maybe I should be asking about Kiplings later life... some say he died a 'broken man'... what is the evidence of this?
How did his relationship with Rhodes fare after his son's death? 
Did Rhodes or Jameson offer any kind of help, advice or solace?
Actually maybe its better I ask this question:
Can you give me a more detailed timeline that tracks the lives of Kipling, his wife, Cecil Rhodes, Leander Jameson, and Kiplings children... at each relevant life milestone I would like to know the ages of each of the people involved, this way I can contextualise things based on my own age.
For example a some lines in the timeline might look something like:
1865 Rudyard Kipling born in Bombay - CR 20 years old - LJ 15 years old
1897 John Kipling born - RK 35 years old, CR 55, LJ 34 etc

And the last question... Cecil Rhodes is the Rhodes in 'Rhodes Scholar'? I don't know much about Cecil but it seems pretty amazing that he named a country after himself? (Rhodesia?) How does one person get so rich or powerful? If some of Rhodes activities were morally questionable, do 'Rhodes scholars' acknowledge that at all?

# Response 2
Absolutely — the historical figure you’re asking about, **Sir Leander Starr Jameson**, *is indeed central* to your understanding of *If—* because he’s widely recognised as the **real-life inspiration for Kipling’s poem**. I’ll walk through who he was, his connection to Kipling, the moral tensions you’re interested in, and then answer all your other questions — including a **detailed comparative timeline** of the people you mentioned (*Kipling, his family, Rhodes, and Jameson*), and a clear explanation of **Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes Scholarship**.

## 🧑‍⚕️ **Who Was Leander Starr Jameson — and Why Did Kipling Admire Him?**

**Leander Starr Jameson** (1853–1917) was a **British colonial administrator and politician** most famous for leading the *Jameson Raid* — an unauthorised incursion into the Boer-controlled Transvaal in South Africa from **December 1895 to January 1896**. The Raid was intended to provoke an uprising by British-aligned settlers (Uitlanders) and overthrow the Boer government, eventually adding the territory to British colonial rule. The action failed spectacularly; Jameson’s force was surrounded and compelled to surrender. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1])

Despite its strategic disaster, **Jameson took personal responsibility** for the expedition. In the British-controlled colonies he was lionised as a figure of bravery and optimism — a man who faced criticism without retreating. Historiography suggests *If—* was, in part, intended by Kipling as a **celebration of those personal qualities** of resolve under pressure. ([Wikipedia][2])

Jameson and **Cecil Rhodes were close friends** and collaborators. Jameson had been Rhodes’s agent — helping secure mineral concessions from African rulers and administering newly claimed territories (which became Rhodesia). Rhodes later appointed him as a politician; Jameson became **Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–1908)**. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1])

---

## 🧭 **Colonial Administrator and “Blind Obedience”**

A **colonial administrator** like Jameson was responsible for managing a colony on behalf of imperial interests — administering law and order, overseeing economic development, and often enforcing the policies of colonial governments or private companies (like Cecil Rhodes’s British South Africa Company). In such a role, **discipline, loyalty, and obedience to higher directives were framed at the time as virtues** — even when those directives meant expansion, expropriation, or war. Those qualities dovetail with *If—*’s celebration of resolute conduct, though now we challenge whether obedience should *ever* be without ethical scrutiny. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1])

---

## ⚠️ **A Morally Questionable Act by Jameson**

**The Jameson Raid itself** is a major example of questionable ethics. It was:

* An invasion launched without clear authorization from the British cabinet
* Based on a false assumption that an uprising was ready (it wasn’t)
* A military action designed to overthrow a sovereign government

Although not militarily successful, it *did* intensify tension between British authorities and Boers — contributing to the **Second Boer War (1899–1902)**. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][3])

So Jameson is a good example of someone who **embodied “calm under pressure” and personal courage** but whose actions helped justify imperial conquest.

---

## 🌍 **Jameson as a “Success Story” in His Own Terms**

From the perspective of his colonial peers:

* **He survived imprisonment and trial in London** after the raid
* **He returned to political influence**, eventually leading the Cape Colony
* **He was honoured as a baronet and later buried (by Rhodes’s own wishes) on a site designated for those who served British Africa well** — a symbolic “earth and everything that’s in it” in imperial thinking. ([Wikipedia][2])

This contrast — *personal heroic endurance* versus *ethical consequences* — mirrors exactly the tension you felt in *If—*.

---

## 🧠 **Why Was Kipling “Blind” to Imperial Harm?**

Several factors help explain Kipling’s imperial enthusiasm:

1. **Born into a colonial world:** Kipling was born in British India and grew up steeped in the assumptions of Victorian empire. Imperial rule was not *exceptional* in his personal context — it was normal. ([Wikipedia][4])

2. **Cultural framework:** At the time, many British writers, politicians, and intellectuals equally assumed empire meant progress, order, or civilisation. Critiques existed, but they were marginal. Kipling’s worldview was shaped by *that* mainstream culture.

3. **Personal connections:** Kipling’s friendships with influential imperialists like Rhodes and Jameson reinforced rather than challenged his assumptions. ([Wikipedia][2])

4. **War sentiment:** Even after his son’s death in World War I, Kipling did **not renounce imperialism or war**. He remained pro-war in his pamphlets and poems and embraced anti-German rhetoric — his grief did not translate into pacifism or anti-imperialism. ([Wikipedia][4])

So, there isn’t strong evidence that Kipling underwent a *dramatic moral conversion* later in life — at least not in surviving writings.

---

## 🪶 **Was Kipling a “Broken Man” When He Died?**

Some commentators describe Kipling as sorrowful in later life — largely due to his son John’s death — but he continued to write, travel, and attend public events until his health declined. He died in **1936 at age 70**, not destitute or silent but still engaged in literary life. His reputation, however, *did* become increasingly controversial as the age of empire waned and critiques of colonialism became more influential. ([Wikipedia][4])

---

## 🧾 **Did Rhodes or Jameson Provide Support to Kipling After His Son Died?**

There is no clear evidence that Rhodes (who died in 1902) or Jameson (who died in 1917) played any role in comforting Kipling after his son’s death in 1915. Rhodes was already dead, and Jameson was far more political than personal in his relationships. Their influence was mostly in the *world Kipling inhabited* — not in the *personal psychological sphere of his grief*.

* Exact birth year for Carrie is less frequently documented but widely assumed to be similar to Kipling’s.

This timeline lets you see — for example — that Kipling’s son was just 18 when he died, and that Rhodes was already dead before World War I began.

---

## 🎓 **Cecil Rhodes and the “Rhodes Scholarship”**

Yes — *the Rhodes in “Rhodes Scholar” is Cecil John Rhodes*. His will **endowed scholarships at Oxford University** designed to educate young leaders from around the British world (and later internationally). ([Wikipedia][5])

At the time of his will, the scholarship *explicitly favoured white male candidates*, reflective of Rhodes’s own imperial beliefs. Women were not eligible until **1977**, and black Africans were largely excluded until later in the 20th century — despite a clause about disregarding “race” in theory. ([Rhodes University][6])

Today, Rhodes Scholarships are prestigious but also deeply contested. Movements such as “Rhodes Must Fall” have called attention to the scholarship’s origins in a racist imperialist worldview and have sought to reform how Rhodes’s legacy is acknowledged. ([Contested Histories][7])

---

## 🧠 **Putting It All Together**

* **Kipling admired Jameson’s courage and steadfastness**, which is a major reason *If—* became associated with him. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Jameson’s actions were deeply tied to British imperial aims**, which many today regard as exploitative and harmful. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1])
* **Kipling himself never became an outspoken anti-imperialist**, even after personal loss; his later writings still reflected support for war and empire. ([Wikipedia][4])
* **Cecil Rhodes amassed wealth and power through mining and political influence**, and his scholarship legacy is still debated today because of his white supremacist views. ([Wikipedia][8])

---

If you’d like, I can also write a *short critical essay* on how *If—* reflects imperialist assumptions, or help draft a *conversation-ready explanation* you could use when discussing it with others. Let me know!
