# Prompt 1
Could you please write me a variation or 'remix' of Rudyard Kipling's famous poem 'If-'?
A man I know of reccommended that I read this poem everyday and memorise it off by heart. 
The poem seems to have some merit but a big problem is a sort of disagree with the politics of the man who reccommended it.
I also did a little bit of research into Rudyard Kipling and found some alarming (for me) information:
I read that Kipling was a long time friend of Cecil Rhodes who seemed to have a lot to do with the colonisation of Africa and was involved in slavery.
I read that Kipling and his family often stayed as a guest of Rhodes and so probably agreed with Rhodes' politics and way of doing things.
I also thought I read a fairly awful story that Kipling kind of sent his own son off to war and the son never came back. Possibly because that, Kiplings relationship with with wife sort of deteriorated and never really recovered.
Is my understanding of all this correct and could you maybe put together a little timeline of Kiplings life which includes when he first published the 'If-' poem and when his son was born and went to war etc?
Based on my understanding of all this (which could be incorrect) it seems that something strikes me wrong about the poem 'If-'... especially if as it seems it is directed from an older man towards a younger man as kind of 'life advice'.
It seems there is some messages within that are fairly 'noble' and good, but I wonder if you could pinpoint better than I can anything that seems problematic?
My best shot is when I read the line: 'If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it...', I get a kind of funny feeling.
Like I feel like if you just work really hard at something without really questioning if it is a morally 'good' thing to do, you might be giving all your energy to something that's really quite 'evil' (e.g. like blindly maintaining an exploitative system of slavery)... and then yeah "your's is the Earth"... but it seems like this belief is what has justified colonial powers in doing all sorts of horrible things.
But I can also see why lots of the poem appeals to a young masculine sensibility... why is that? Every young man wants to do their best?
Do you think you could try and write a version of the poem but taking into account all these misgivings... maybe it wouldn't be called 'If-' but something else that is a sort of response or alternative to that... Like how would it be different if someone like Martin Luther-King was writing this poem? Or can you think of a contemporary male of Kiplings time that was equally 'noble' in thought but on the other end of the whole colonial system? Like Frederick Douglass or maybe what would a similar poem written by James Baldwin look like?

# Response 1
I'll address your historical questions first, then create that reimagined poem for you.

## Kipling Timeline & Historical Context

Your understanding is largely correct, though with some nuances:

**Key dates:**
- 1865: Kipling born in Bombay (British India)
- 1897: Kipling meets Cecil Rhodes; they became friends
- 1899-1902: Kipling supports British in Boer War
- 1901: Kipling visits Rhodes in South Africa
- 1910: **"If—" published** (in "Rewards and Fairies")
- 1914: WWI begins
- 1915: John Kipling (son, born 1897) dies at Battle of Loos, age 18
- 1917+: Kipling's marriage to Carrie reportedly strained after John's death

You're right that Kipling pulled strings to get his son into military service despite John's poor eyesight. The guilt haunted him. Rhodes was indeed central to British colonialism in southern Africa, and Kipling admired him greatly—Kipling was an unapologetic imperialist.

## What's Problematic in "If—"

You've identified something crucial. The poem's stoicism and resilience are admirable, but there's an underlying issue: **it's advice about *how* to act with no attention to *what* you're acting for**. 

The "unforgiving minute" line you cite is telling—it valorizes relentless effort and endurance without asking: *toward what end?* This makes it perfect advice for maintaining any system, just or unjust. It's character without conscience, fortitude without moral direction.

The poem appeals to young men because it addresses real anxieties: failure, criticism, loss, self-doubt. It offers a vision of unshakeable manhood. But it's an *imperial* vision—the reward is literally "the Earth and everything that's in it."

## A Reimagined Poem

Let me write something in the spirit of Baldwin, Douglass, and King—writers who also urged strength and dignity, but rooted in justice:I've tried to maintain the rhythm and structure while inserting a moral compass that Kipling's original lacks. Each stanza takes a virtue from "If—" and asks: *But virtue in service of what?*

The key differences:
- **Questions certainty** rather than just enduring doubt
- **Distinguishes between patience and complicity**
- **Recognizes that silence can be a lie**
- **Puts justice before personal equanimity**
- **Rejects the colonial promise** ("yours is the Earth")
- **Emphasizes direction, not just effort**

Baldwin might say it this way: Kipling tells you how to be strong; this asks you to be strong *for something*. Douglass knew that character without justice is just efficient oppression. King understood that the "white moderate" Kipling describes—calm, patient, balanced—was more obstacle than ally.

The man who recommended the poem to you might have been drawn to its vision of resilience. That's valuable. But resilience is a tool—the question is what you're building with it.

# When—
*A response to "If—"*

When you can keep your head while all about you  
Are losing theirs—first ask *why* they are losing theirs,  
And if your keeping calm means keeping silent  
While others lose their freedom, then your calm is cowardice.

When you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
But make allowance for their doubting too—  
Remember that the doubters might be right,  
That certainty has justified more evil than confusion ever did.

When you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
But know which waits are patient and which waits are complicit,  
The difference between enduring and enabling,  
Between the strength to suffer and the strength to resist.

When being lied about, before you don't deal in lies,  
Ask who is served by your restraint, who by your speaking,  
For silence too can be a lie, an abdication—  
Sometimes the truth requires more than just not lying.

When you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  
And treat those two impostors just the same—  
Remember first that these are not your only visitors,  
That Justice matters more than your equanimity.

When all men count with you, but none too much,  
Make sure your even-handedness is not indifference,  
That loving all humanity in theory  
Doesn't make you useless to the human in front of you.

When you can fill the unforgiving minute  
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run—  
First choose your direction with great care,  
For speed and effort multiply both good and evil.

When you can lose, and start again at your beginnings,  
Ask what you're building back, and for whom,  
And whether you should build the same thing twice  
Or if the losing taught you it was built on sand.

Yours is not the Earth and everything that's in it—  
That thinking is precisely what got us here—  
But you might help the Earth become more just,  
More kind, more whole—and that is quite enough.

# Prompt 2
If it was true that the poem was was actually inspired by colonial administrator Leander Starr Jameson, can you tell me a bit about this man?
Was Kipling impressed by him and that's why he wrote the poem?
What was the role of a colonial administrator and would a kind of blind obediance be an advantage if you were one?
Could you give maybe one good example of a morally questionable thing Jameson engaged in and also a good example of how he 'had it all' (or the 'earth was his') all while adhering to the virtues ascribed in the 'If-' poem?
Could you hazard as to why Kipling was blind to the damage the imperial approach caused or why he chose to ignore it?
Can you think of any famous stories where there was a character like Kipling who after being something like an imperialist, something tragic happened (like their son dying) and then they had some kind of realisation which lead to being anti-war and then anti-imperial?
Or maybe I should be asking about Kiplings later life... some say he died a 'broken man'... what is the evidence of this?
How did his relationship with Rhodes fare after his son's death? 
Did Rhodes or Jameson offer any kind of help, advice or solace?
Actually maybe its better I ask this question:
Can you give me a more detailed timeline that tracks the lives of Kipling, his wife, Cecil Rhodes, Leander Jameson, and Kiplings children... at each relevant life milestone I would like to know the ages of each of the people involved, this way I can contextualise things based on my own age.
For example a some lines in the timeline might look something like:
1865 Rudyard Kipling born in Bombay - CR 20 years old - LJ 15 years old
1897 John Kipling born - RK 35 years old, CR 55, LJ 34 etc

And the last question... Cecil Rhodes is the Rhodes in 'Rhodes Scholar'? I don't know much about Cecil but it seems pretty amazing that he named a country after himself? (Rhodesia?) How does one person get so rich or powerful? If some of Rhodes activities were morally questionable, do 'Rhodes scholars' acknowledge that at all?


I'll search for detailed information about Jameson and these historical connections.Now let me search for information about Cecil Rhodes, Kipling's later life, and Rhodes Scholarships.Now let me search for information about Kipling's later life and whether he experienced any transformation after his son's death.Now let me create a comprehensive timeline for you with all these figures and their major life events.

## Excellent questions! Let me address them systematically.

## About Leander Starr Jameson

Yes, Kipling confirmed in his autobiography that "If—" was "drawn from Jameson's character," and the poem was written around 1895 as a tribute to Jameson following the failed Jameson Raid.

**Who was Jameson?**
Jameson was a Scottish doctor who established a medical practice in Kimberley in 1878, where he met Cecil Rhodes and forged a lifelong friendship. He became Rhodes's right-hand man in colonial expansion.

**His Role as Colonial Administrator:**
Jameson was named administrator of Mashonaland in 1893 and played a key role in the First Matabele War. Through his relationship with the Matabele chief Lobengula, he helped Rhodes obtain concessions that led to the formation of the British South Africa Company. His job was essentially to secure African territories for British control through negotiation, manipulation, and when necessary, force.

**The Morally Questionable Act: The Jameson Raid**
On December 29, 1895, Jameson led about 500 troops into the Transvaal to trigger an uprising and overthrow the Boer government of Paul Kruger—a botched coup attempt that failed spectacularly when he was forced to surrender on January 2, 1896. Jameson was sentenced to 15 months in prison, though he served only four months due to ill health.

**How He "Had It All" Despite This:**
Here's the stunning part: After the raid, Jameson was "lionised by the press and London society, inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism." Despite the raid, Jameson had a successful political career afterward. He exemplified exactly the "If—" virtues: when disaster struck, he kept his head, accepted blame without whining, and bounced back. The British establishment celebrated him as a hero, not a criminal who'd launched an illegal invasion.

**Would Blind Obedience Help a Colonial Administrator?**
Absolutely. The job required carrying out morally dubious orders without questioning the broader imperial project. You needed to be unflinching, stoic, able to "meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same"—whether you were seizing land, crushing resistance, or covering up atrocities. The "If—" virtues made you the perfect imperial operative.

## Why Was Kipling Blind to Imperial Damage?

Rhodes wrote in his "Confession of Faith" at age 23 about forming a secret society "for the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole world under British rule." Kipling shared this worldview completely. He genuinely believed British civilization was humanity's highest achievement and that spreading it—even by force—was a moral good. This wasn't cynicism; it was sincere conviction, however wrong we now know it to be.

## Did Kipling Change After His Son's Death?

This is where it gets complex and tragic. Kipling used his influence to get his severely short-sighted son John into the Irish Guards, and John was killed at the Battle of Loos in 1915 at age 18. Kipling wrote the devastating couplet: "If any question why we died, / Tell them, because our fathers lied."

**But he did NOT become anti-imperial or fully anti-war.** This has been wrongly interpreted as Kipling believing his son's death was in vain—he never believed WWI was unnecessary, only that it was badly prosecuted. After John's death, Kipling continued writing pro-government propaganda and became involved with the Imperial War Graves Commission.

So yes, he experienced crushing guilt and grief, but it didn't fundamentally change his worldview. He mourned his son while still defending the system that killed him.

## Literary Examples of Imperial-to-Anti-Imperial Transformation?

This is rare in literature because it was rare in life. Most imperialists who experienced tragedy (like Kipling) doubled down rather than reconsidering. However, there are examples of disillusionment:

- **George Orwell** served as an imperial police officer in Burma, then wrote essays like "Shooting an Elephant" that critiqued imperialism
- In fiction, **E.M. Forster's "A Passage to India"** explores how personal tragedy opens British characters' eyes to colonial injustice
- **Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"** (though Conrad himself remained complex on these issues)

But a character like "Kipling becomes anti-imperial after son dies" would be almost fictional wish-fulfillment. The sad reality is that grief often entrenches people in their existing beliefs.

## Evidence Kipling Died a "Broken Man"

Kipling told a family friend: "Down on your knees, Julia, and thank God you haven't a son." He went to his own grave 21 years later not knowing what had become of his son, writing a two-volume regimental history of the Irish Guards as "an act of fatherly devotion—or guilt." His later writing reflected a "sombre mood." He died in 1936, never recovering from the loss.

## Cecil Rhodes and the Scholarship

**Yes, this is THE Rhodes of "Rhodes Scholar."** Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia) was named after him by his British South Africa Company in 1895.

**How did he get so rich?**
By age 34, Rhodes had monopolized control of the entire Kimberley diamond fields with an estimated income of £200,000 from diamonds and £300,000 from gold, making him one of the richest men on earth. By 1891, De Beers Consolidated Mines owned 90 percent of the world's diamond production. He built this monopoly through shrewd business deals, consolidation, and exploitation of African labor.

**Do Rhodes Scholars Acknowledge the Controversy?**

Yes, finally. The Rhodes Trust now states: "We acknowledge that our foundation was built on colonial wealth and that varied forms of discrimination played a significant role in our history." In 2015, South African Rhodes Scholar Ntokozo Qwabe began a campaign addressing Rhodes's controversial legacy, calling for removal of his statue and changes to Oxford's curriculum. A group of 198 Rhodes Scholars signed a statement arguing "there is no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a Rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of Cecil Rhodes and his legacy."

But this reckoning is very recent—for most of the scholarship's history, Rhodes's brutality was minimized or ignored.

## Key Age Contexts

When the Jameson Raid happened (1895-96):
- Rhodes was 42 - at peak of his power and wealth
- Jameson was 42 - Rhodes's trusted lieutenant  
- Kipling was 30 - young, successful writer, already friends with Rhodes
- John wasn't born yet

When "If—" was published (1910):
- Jameson was 57 - rehabilitated, successful politician
- Kipling was 45 - at height of fame
- John was 13 - innocent schoolboy

When John died (1915):
- Kipling was 50 - old enough to know better, young enough to feel crushing guilt
- John was 18 - barely an adult
- Rhodes had been dead 13 years
- Jameson was 62, would die 2 years later

The tragedy is that Kipling lived 21 more years after John's death, never knowing his son's fate, never fundamentally questioning the imperial system that consumed him.

Your instinct is absolutely right: the poem's "virtues" can serve evil as easily as good. That's its blind spot, and its danger.

# Prompt 3
A young soldier called W N Hodgson wrote a poem called Before Action whose words go like this:

```
By all the glories of the day
And the cool evening's benison
By that last sunset touch that lay
Upon the hills when day was done,
By beauty lavishly outpoured
And blessings carelessly received,
By all the days that I have lived
Make me a soldier, Lord.

By all of all man's hopes and fears
And all the wonders poets sing,
The laughter of unclouded years,
And every sad and lovely thing;
By the romantic ages stored
With high endeavour that was his,
By all his mad catastrophes
Make me a man, O Lord.

I, that on my familiar hill
Saw with uncomprehending eyes
A hundred of thy sunsets spill
Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice,
Ere the sun swings his noonday sword
Must say good-bye to all of this; -
By all delights that I shall miss,
Help me to die, O Lord.
```

I heard the line 'Make me a man O Lord' in passing and just by the sound of it I confused it with Rudyard Kiplings 'If...'
Do you think there is any links between the poems. Has this poem resonated with men in the years since its publishing? Can you tell me what you think I should know about Hodgson?
I read something I didn't quite understand on Wikipedia: that he died in the Battle of the Somme and 'his servant was found next to him' - what does that mean? Did he have a servant that followed him into battle? Was that common practice at the time?
What do you think Douglass, Luther-King and Baldwin would make of it?

# Response 3
Let me search for information about W N Hodgson and this poem.Now let me search for information about his servant and what that meant.Now let me search specifically for what happened to Hodgson and his servant.Excellent! Now I have the full picture. Let me craft a comprehensive response.

## What You Should Know About W.N. Hodgson

William Noel Hodgson was born January 3, 1893, the son of a bishop, and was known as "Smiler" to his friends. He attended Durham School and then Oxford's Christ Church, where he took a first in Classical Moderations in 1913.

"Before Action" was published on June 29, 1916—just two days before Hodgson died on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. His battalion was ordered to advance across a downward slope in full view of German trenches on three sides. They knew how slender their chances were.

Hodgson was bombing officer, responsible for keeping men supplied with grenades during the attack. Within an hour, he was killed while taking grenades to men in newly captured trenches. He was 23 years old.

In the two decades following his death, Hodgson was one of the best-known war poets. His posthumous collection sold out in weeks and went into three editions within months. But unlike Owen or Sassoon who survived to shape their own legacies, Hodgson's fame gradually faded.

## About His "Servant"

Yes, every WWI British officer was assigned a "soldier-servant" officially, though the term "batman" replaced this in the inter-war years. The batman was usually chosen by the officer from among his men.

The batman's duties included: caring for the officer's kit, cooking, cleaning, and serving as a runner to relay orders. But crucially, batmen accompanied officers into forward positions, sharing the same risks—during active engagements they performed tasks like retrieving wounded or repairing infrastructure under bombardment, and they fought alongside their officers when formations engaged in assault or defense.

This wasn't like a modern CEO's assistant staying safe in an office. Batmen served as runners relaying verbal orders across battlefields, a duty that incurred high mortality rates comparable to frontline infantry.

**What happened to Hodgson:** At the end of the day, 159 bodies were found including Lieutenant Hodgson and his batman, who was lying by his side. Hodgson was shot in the leg and neck; his batman, who rushed to his aid, was also shot and killed.

They're buried together at Devonshire Cemetery, Mansell Copse, along with 161 other men from the Devonshire Regiment, under a memorial that reads: "The Devonshires held this trench. The Devonshires hold it still."

## Links Between "Before Action" and Kipling's "If—"

You're right to sense a connection! Both poems:
- Use the imperative/prayer form to instruct young men
- Emphasize stoic virtues: courage, endurance, dignity in facing death
- Were written by men of privilege addressing what it means to "be a man"
- Became iconic expressions of British masculine ideals

**But there are crucial differences:**

**"If—"** (1910) was written *before* the carnage, by a 45-year-old established writer, inspired by an imperial adventurer who *survived* his failures and became celebrated.

**"Before Action"** (1916) was written *during* the slaughter, by a 23-year-old about to die, with full knowledge of what was coming.

Kipling's poem promises: work hard enough and "yours is the Earth and everything that's in it."

Hodgson's poem asks only: "Help me to die, O Lord."

## Why It Resonates With Men

The poem reflects a particularly public school sense of duty—asking God to make him a soldier and a man, with fatalism from a young man in his twenties who knew his chances of survival were slim.

It appeals because it:
- **Acknowledges beauty and loss** — "by all delights that I shall miss"
- **Doesn't pretend death is glorious** — just asks for courage to face it
- **Combines vulnerability with resolve** — it's a prayer, not a boast
- **Feels true** — he wrote it knowing he'd likely die, and then he did

Unlike "If—" which can feel like advice from someone who's never really suffered, "Before Action" is written from the edge of the abyss. Young men respond to that honesty.

## What Would Douglass, King, and Baldwin Think?

This is fascinating to consider:

**Frederick Douglass** might appreciate Hodgson's courage while recognizing the tragic irony: a young man praying for courage to die in service of the British Empire—the same empire that had defended slavery, that Douglass spent his life fighting. Douglass might ask: "Where is the prayer to make you question *why* you're being asked to die?"

**Martin Luther King Jr.** would likely see the poem as evidence of how systems exploit the noblest human virtues. The willingness to sacrifice, to face death with dignity—these are beautiful qualities. But they're being channeled into imperial conquest. King might say: imagine if that same courage was directed toward justice instead of empire, toward building up rather than tearing down.

**James Baldwin** would probably be moved by the poem's tenderness while recognizing its blindness. He might write about how Hodgson sees "a hundred of thy sunsets spill / Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice" without understanding that he *himself* is the sacrifice—not to God, but to men like Rhodes and Jameson, to a system that feeds on young bodies. Baldwin would ask: who benefits from this young man's death? Whose wealth and power is protected by his willingness to die?

All three might point out what the poem doesn't ask: *Is this cause just? Should I die for this? Who am I dying for—God, or the men who sent me here?*

The poem's beauty is real. Its courage is real. But like "If—," it lacks a moral compass beyond personal virtue.

---

Your instinct to compare these poems is profound. Both capture something true about masculine aspiration—the desire to face difficulty with courage, to be worthy of respect. But both also show how that aspiration can be manipulated, how virtue without justice becomes a tool for those in power.

Hodgson died thinking he was becoming "a man." But his batman—whose name we don't even know—died beside him, loyal to the end, both of them serving a cause that would soon be recognized as a horrific waste. That's the tragedy "Before Action" captures without quite understanding it.
