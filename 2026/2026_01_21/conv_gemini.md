# Prompt 1
Could you please write me a variation or 'remix' of Rudyard Kipling's famous poem 'If-'?
A man I know of reccommended that I read this poem everyday and memorise it off by heart. 
The poem seems to have some merit but a big problem is a sort of disagree with the politics of the man who reccommended it.
I also did a little bit of research into Rudyard Kipling and found some alarming (for me) information:
I read that Kipling was a long time friend of Cecil Rhodes who seemed to have a lot to do with the colonisation of Africa and was involved in slavery.
I read that Kipling and his family often stayed as a guest of Rhodes and so probably agreed with Rhodes' politics and way of doing things.
I also thought I read a fairly awful story that Kipling kind of sent his own son off to war and the son never came back. Possibly because that, Kiplings relationship with with wife sort of deteriorated and never really recovered.
Is my understanding of all this correct and could you maybe put together a little timeline of Kiplings life which includes when he first published the 'If-' poem and when his son was born and went to war etc?
Based on my understanding of all this (which could be incorrect) it seems that something strikes me wrong about the poem 'If-'... especially if as it seems it is directed from an older man towards a younger man as kind of 'life advice'.
It seems there is some messages within that are fairly 'noble' and good, but I wonder if you could pinpoint better than I can anything that seems problematic?
My best shot is when I read the line: 'If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it...', I get a kind of funny feeling.
Like I feel like if you just work really hard at something without really questioning if it is a morally 'good' thing to do, you might be giving all your energy to something that's really quite 'evil' (e.g. like blindly maintaining an exploitative system of slavery)... and then yeah "your's is the Earth"... but it seems like this belief is what has justified colonial powers in doing all sorts of horrible things.
But I can also see why lots of the poem appeals to a young masculine sensibility... why is that? Every young man wants to do their best?
Do you think you could try and write a version of the poem but taking into account all these misgivings... maybe it wouldn't be called 'If-' but something else that is a sort of response or alternative to that... Like how would it be different if someone like Martin Luther-King was writing this poem? Or can you think of a contemporary male of Kiplings time that was equally 'noble' in thought but on the other end of the whole colonial system? Like Frederick Douglass or maybe what would a similar poem written by James Baldwin look like?

# Response 1
Hello. It sounds like you are wrestling with a very real and complex literary dilemma: how to separate a piece of art from the artist, and whether you even *should* when the artist's values seem to contradict your own.

Your research and intuition are spot on. You have correctly identified the "shadow side" of Rudyard Kipling, and your unease with the poem "If—" is shared by many modern critics and readers.

Here is the confirmation of your research, the timeline you asked for, an analysis of *why* the poem feels the way it does, and finally, a "remix" written from a completely different perspective as you requested.

### 1. Fact-Check: Was your understanding correct?

**Yes.** You are largely correct on all counts.

* **The Cecil Rhodes Connection:** Kipling was indeed a close friend and admirer of Cecil Rhodes (the diamond magnate and colonialist politician). For many years, Kipling and his family spent their winters at a house called "The Woolsack" on Rhodes' private estate in South Africa. Kipling was a vocal supporter of British Imperialism and believed in the "White Man's Burden"—the idea that it was the moral duty of white powers to colonize and "civilize" other nations.
* **The Son's Death:** This is the most tragic part of the story. His son, John (Jack), desperately wanted to join the army for WWI but was rejected multiple times because he had terribly poor eyesight. Kipling used his high-level connections (specifically Lord Roberts) to bypass the medical checks and get John a commission as an officer. John was killed in his very first battle (Battle of Loos) at age 18.
* **The Wife's Reaction:** Kipling's wife, Carrie, was devastated. While the couple remained together, the guilt and grief hung over the rest of their lives. Kipling spent years searching for his son's grave (which was not identified until decades later).

### 2. Timeline of Events

Here is the timeline illustrating the relationship between the poet, the poem, and the tragedy.

| Year | Event | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1865** | **Rudyard Kipling Born** | Born in Bombay, British India. |
| **1895** | **"If—" Written (Approx)** | Kipling writes the draft. Note: His son is not born yet. The poem was actually inspired by a colonial administrator (Leander Starr Jameson), not initially his son. |
| **1896** | **Begins Visiting Rhodes** | Kipling begins annual winter visits to South Africa, staying as a guest of **Cecil Rhodes**. |
| **1897** | **Son John (Jack) Born** | Kipling's only son is born. |
| **1910** | **"If—" Published** | Published in the collection *Rewards and Fairies*. It becomes an instant sensation. John is 13 years old—the prime age for this "advice." |
| **1914** | **WWI Begins** | John tries to enlist but is rejected due to poor eyesight. **Kipling pulls strings** to get him in. |
| **1915** | **John Killed in Action** | September 27. John goes missing at the Battle of Loos. He is just **18 years old**. |
| **1936** | **Rudyard Kipling Dies** | He dies a celebrated but broken man, having never fully recovered from the loss of his children (his daughter had also died young). |

### 3. Why does "If—" feel problematic?

You hit on a profound insight with your comment about the "unforgiving minute."

The poem appeals to a "young masculine sensibility" because it advocates for **Stoicism**: emotional control, resilience, and self-mastery. These are useful tools for a young person trying to navigate a chaotic world.

However, the "problem" you sensed is that this Stoicism is **amoral**.

* **The "Stiff Upper Lip":** The poem teaches you *how* to endure, but not *what* to endure for.
* **The Colonial Tool:** In the context of the British Empire, this "unquestioning endurance" was exactly what was required of young men sent to administer colonies or fight wars. They were taught to suppress their feelings ("don't give way to hating," "never breathe a word about your loss") so they could function as cogs in the Imperial machine.
* **The Tragedy:** This specific code of manhood—suppressing weakness, pushing through pain, seeking "distance run"—is exactly what led Kipling to push his half-blind son into a war that killed him.

### 4. The Remix

You asked for a version written by someone like **James Baldwin**.

James Baldwin (1924–1987) was a brilliant American writer and civil rights activist. His style was the opposite of Kipling's; where Kipling advocated for emotional suppression and domination, Baldwin advocated for **radical vulnerability, bearing witness to history, and the power of love over power.**

Here is a reimagining of the poem. It replaces the "Colonial Administrator" advice with "Civil Rights Activist" advice.

#### **"Listen—"**

*(A response to Kipling, in the voice of James Baldwin)*

If you can keep your heart when all about you
Are freezing theirs to turn their pain to stone,
If you can love the ones who fear and doubt you
And know their fear is history, not your own;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
But in the waiting, forge a sharper mind,
And being hated, understand the hating
Is the rot of those who leave their souls behind;

If you can dream—and know that dreams are dangerous,
If you can think—and make the truth your aim;
If you can meet the sheriff and the savior
And know that both know nothing of your name;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Denied by those who profit from the lie,
Or watch the children that you cherish, broken,
And hold them close, and never let them die:

If you can look at history’s bloody winnings
And see the theft beneath the coin and gloss,
And claim your beauty at the new beginnings
And never let them shame you for the loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve the weak long after hope is gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the prayer that says to them: “Go on!”

If you can talk to crowds and keep your spirit,
Or walk with Kings—and tell them they are naked,
If neither laws nor batons make you fear it,
If you can see the bond, however sacred;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of truth and grace,
Yours is the Soul, and everything within it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, in this place.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature | Kipling's "If—" | The Baldwin "Remix" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Dominance ("Yours is the Earth") | Integrity ("Yours is the Soul") |
| **Dealing with Enemies** | Ignore them / Don't give way to hate | Understand them / Analyze their fear |
| **Dealing with Pain** | Hide it ("Never breathe a word") | Witness it / Hold onto it for strength |
| **Action** | Productivity ("Distance run") | Truth ("Truth and grace") |
| **Relationship to Authority** | "Walk with Kings nor lose the common touch" | "Walk with Kings and tell them they are naked" |

**Would you like me to analyze any specific stanza of the new poem to explain the historical references (like "tell them they are naked")?**

# Prompt 2
If it was true that the poem was was actually inspired by colonial administrator Leander Starr Jameson, can you tell me a bit about this man?
Was Kipling impressed by him and that's why he wrote the poem?
What was the role of a colonial administrator and would a kind of blind obediance be an advantage if you were one?
Could you give maybe one good example of a morally questionable thing Jameson engaged in and also a good example of how he 'had it all' (or the 'earth was his') all while adhering to the virtues ascribed in the 'If-' poem?
Could you hazard as to why Kipling was blind to the damage the imperial approach caused or why he chose to ignore it?
Can you think of any famous stories where there was a character like Kipling who after being something like an imperialist, something tragic happened (like their son dying) and then they had some kind of realisation which lead to being anti-war and then anti-imperial?
Or maybe I should be asking about Kiplings later life... some say he died a 'broken man'... what is the evidence of this?
How did his relationship with Rhodes fare after his son's death? 
Did Rhodes or Jameson offer any kind of help, advice or solace?
Actually maybe its better I ask this question:
Can you give me a more detailed timeline that tracks the lives of Kipling, his wife, Cecil Rhodes, Leander Jameson, and Kiplings children... at each relevant life milestone I would like to know the ages of each of the people involved, this way I can contextualise things based on my own age.
For example a some lines in the timeline might look something like:
1865 Rudyard Kipling born in Bombay - CR 20 years old - LJ 15 years old
1897 John Kipling born - RK 35 years old, CR 55, LJ 34 etc

And the last question... Cecil Rhodes is the Rhodes in 'Rhodes Scholar'? I don't know much about Cecil but it seems pretty amazing that he named a country after himself? (Rhodesia?) How does one person get so rich or powerful? If some of Rhodes activities were morally questionable, do 'Rhodes scholars' acknowledge that at all?

# Response 2
This is a fascinating deconstruction of the history behind the poem. You are asking exactly the right questions to peel back the layers of myth surrounding Kipling and his circle.

Here is the breakdown of Leander Starr Jameson, the timeline you requested, and the truth about Rhodes.

### 1. Who was Leander Starr Jameson ("Dr. Jim")?

**Was Kipling impressed by him?**
Yes, immensely. Kipling explicitly stated in his autobiography that "If—" was "drawn from Jameson's character."

**The "Morally Questionable" Act (The Jameson Raid):**
In **1895**, Jameson led a failed, illegal military invasion into the Boer Republic (Transvaal) in South Africa. The plan was to trigger an uprising of British expatriate workers and overthrow the Boer government to seize control of the gold mines for British interests (and Cecil Rhodes).

* **The Result:** It was a disaster. The uprising didn't happen. Jameson and his men were surrounded, captured, and humiliated. It was an international embarrassment for Britain.

**How he "adhered to the virtues" of the poem:**
This is the twist. Kipling didn't write "If—" because Jameson won; he wrote it because Jameson **lost** but didn't complain.

* **The Silence:** After the raid failed, Jameson was put on trial. He could have exposed Cecil Rhodes or the British Government as the true architects of the plan to save his own skin. Instead, he kept his mouth shut, took the blame entirely on himself, and went to prison.
* **The Verse:** This specific act of taking the fall without "breathing a word about your loss" is exactly what Kipling idolized.

**Did he "have it all"?**
Eventually, yes. Remarkably, after serving time in prison, Jameson returned to South Africa and eventually became the **Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–1908)**. He proved the line: *"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same."*

### 2. Why was Kipling blind to the damage?

It is difficult to understand today, but Kipling didn't see Imperialism as "conquest"; he saw it as **service**.

* **The Bubble:** He believed that without British rule, these regions would descend into chaos, slavery, and barbarism. He genuinely believed he was on the side of the "light."
* **The Cost of "Manhood":** Kipling's definition of masculinity (the "Stiff Upper Lip") actively discouraged introspection. If you start questioning the *morality* of your orders, you become a less effective soldier/administrator. To be the "Man" in the poem, you must suppress the very empathy that would allow you to see the damage you are doing.

### 3. A Counter-Parallel (The "Anti-Kipling")

You asked for a story of someone who was an imperialist/soldier, suffered a tragedy, and woke up.
A real-life example is **General Smedley Butler**.

* **The Imperialist:** He was a highly decorated US Marine Major General who spent decades fighting "colonial" wars in the Philippines, Central America, and the Caribbean. He was the ultimate "Man" by Kipling's standards.
* **The Realization:** After retiring, he looked back at his career and realized he had been a "gangster for capitalism."
* **The Pivot:** He wrote a famous book called *War Is a Racket* and spent the rest of his life campaigning against the very system he had served.

### 4. The Timeline: Ages and Context

*Note: Ages are approximate based on birth years.*

**Key Figures:**

* **RK:** Rudyard Kipling (Born 1865)
* **CK:** Carrie Kipling (Rudyard's Wife, Born 1862)
* **CR:** Cecil Rhodes (The Titan, Born 1853)
* **LJ:** Leander Starr Jameson (The Inspiration, Born 1853)
* **JK:** John "Jack" Kipling ( The Son, Born 1897)

| **1895** | **The Jameson Raid** (The disaster that inspired "If—"). Jameson is arrested. | 30 | 33 | 42 | 42 | - |
| **1896** | **RK meets CR.** Kipling moves to Torquay; begins visiting Rhodes in South Africa. | 31 | 34 | 43 | 43 | - |
| **1897** | **John (Jack) Kipling Born.** | 32 | 35 | 44 | 44 | **0** |
| **1899** | **Tragedy 1:** Kipling's daughter Josephine dies of pneumonia (age 6). RK is devastated. | 34 | 37 | 46 | 46 | 2 |

| **1914** | **WWI Begins.** Jack is rejected by the Navy and Army (poor eyes). RK pulls strings to get him in. | 49 | 52 | - | 61 | 17 |
| **1915** | **John Killed in Action.** Battle of Loos. | 50 | 53 | - | 62 | **18** |

| **1936** | **Rudyard Kipling Dies.** | **70** | 74 | - | - | - |

**Did Rhodes/Jameson help after the son's death?**

* **Rhodes:** No. He had been dead for 13 years when John was killed.
* **Jameson:** He was alive (died 1917), but he was in very poor health and living in London. There is no famous record of him offering specific "solace" that changed the situation. The Kiplings were largely left alone in their grief.

### 5. Cecil Rhodes: The Man, The Money, The Scholar

**How does one person get that rich?**
Cecil Rhodes was the Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk of his day, but with a private army.

1. **Diamonds:** He founded **De Beers**, which successfully monopolized the global diamond supply. At one point, he owned 90% of the world's diamonds.
2. **The Charter:** He received a "Royal Charter" from the British government for his "British South Africa Company." This effectively gave his private company the legal right to govern territory, make treaties, and form a police force.
3. **Rhodesia:** He used this private army to conquer the lands north of South Africa (modern-day Zimbabwe and Zambia). The territory was named "Rhodesia" in his honor in 1895.

**The Rhodes Scholarship:**

* **What is it?** In his will, Rhodes left his massive fortune to creating a scholarship at Oxford University to bring together young men from the colonies (and the US and Germany) to create a network of "civilized" leaders to prevent future wars.
* **Do they acknowledge it?** Yes. This is a huge topic today. The "Rhodes Must Fall" movement (started in South Africa and Oxford) explicitly challenges his legacy, calling him an architect of apartheid. Modern Rhodes Scholars often accept the money while actively critiquing the man, viewing it as "reparations" or using the resources to dismantle the very systems Rhodes built.

### 6. Was Kipling a "Broken Man"?

The evidence suggests yes.

* **Physical Decline:** After 1915, he suffered from severe, undiagnosed gastric ulcers (likely stress-induced) that caused him constant pain until his death.
* **The Change in Writing:** His pre-war writing is bouncy, rhythmic, and confident ("Jungle Book", "If—"). His post-war writing becomes dark, complex, fragmented, and obsessed with pain and healing.
* **The Epitaph:** Perhaps the most heartbreaking evidence is a short couplet he wrote later in the war, widely interpreted as his own confession regarding his son:
> *"If any question why we died,*
> *Tell them, because our fathers lied."*



This suggests that in the end, Kipling realized that the "truth" he had been selling—the glory of Empire and the nobility of sacrifice—was the lie that killed his son.
