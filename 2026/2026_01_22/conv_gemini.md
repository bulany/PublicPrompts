# Prompt 1
I recently watched a film called something like "my little sister mirai".
In the film there was a scene where a grandfather was teaching a grandson to ride a horse.
The grandfather explained to the grandson that he needs to not look at the stirups and look up at the horizon, otherwise he'll fall off and won't be able to ride the horse. The grandson has a bit of difficulty with this but eventually gets the hang of it.
The horse sort of transforms into a motorbike but the message was the same - you have to keep looking toward the horizon to be able to drive and not at your feet.
I recently had a conversation with an avid motor bike rider and I asked him if this was a 'thing'. He explained that it was critical and in a motor bike riding course he was taught not to look at distracting small details on the road like a little pebble: this could be very dangerous as if you start looking at something your motorbike could end up going there and so you end up running into the very thing you really wanted to avoid.
I'm wondering are these anecdotes really valid and does this phenomena have any theory or language around it?
A friend of mine who was giving me tips about riding a motor bike also said "don't look at the trees on the side of the track... or you'll end up off the track and in the trees... try to keep looking down the track".
I'm wondering if there is some 'deliberate practice' techniques to really work this exercise?
I also feel that in the domain of music... reading and playing music... If I get caught up in the sometimes beautiful sound of what I'm playing, I lose track of where I am in the composition and make a mistake which kind of spoils the whole flow.
I wonder if there could be any practice techniques that could span across domains like music and motor bike riding.
I also wonder why is it so hard to change your gaze once you are locked onto a pebble or the trees? What is the strength or reflex you have to develop to be able to move your gaze back to the 'big picture'?
I'm wondering also if the way we think and 'move through life'... sometimes you can have a really bad day because you are focussed on a negative detail or you are scared of something which actually ends up happening.
I'm wondering if there could be a similar skill one could practice to be able to 'navigate life' more easily and fluidly and avoid getting stuck and bogged down in depressions? 
Is it really actually a similar phenomenon which is occurring across all these different situations?
If you considered words like 'praying' and 'faith', would they have any relationship to these situations? 
I'm thinking if developing the kind of strength or reflex to not focus on the pebbles and keep your eyes looking at where you want to go... maybe that could translate into some concrete and tangible way to develop some kind of faith. 
Before I often thought of faith and praying as very abstract things but maybe they are not so abstract?

# Response 1

This is a profound series of connections you have made, linking a specific scene in an anime to mechanics, neuroscience, music, psychology, and finally, spirituality.

To answer your first question: **Yes, the phenomenon is real, valid, and well-documented.**

Here is a breakdown of the theory, the neuroscience behind it, how to practice it, and how it translates to "navigating life" and the concept of faith.

### 1. The Motorbike Phenomenon: "Target Fixation"

The specific term for what your friend described is **Target Fixation**.

It is a known phenomenon in military aviation, motorcycling, and auto racing. It occurs when an operator becomes so focused on an observed object (usually a threat, like a tree, a pothole, or a pebble) that they inadvertently steer the vehicle toward it.

**Why does this happen?**
*   **Hand-Eye Coordination:** Our bodies are wired to go where we look. If you turn your head and eyes to the right, your shoulders naturally rotate slightly, your weight shifts, and your hands unconsciously adjust the handlebars to steer right.
*   **The Validity:** This is taught in every Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) course. The mantra is: **"Look where you want to go, not at what you want to avoid."**

### 2. Why is it so hard to look away? (The Neuroscience)

You asked why it requires such strength or reflex to unlock your gaze from the "pebble."

*   **Survival Instinct (Amygdala vs. Prefrontal Cortex):** When you see a threat (the tree/pebble), your brain's amygdala (fear center) activates. Evolution has hardwired us to lock our attention onto threats so we can track them. It requires a massive override from the prefrontal cortex (the rational brain) to say, "Ignore the threat, look at the escape route."
*   **Stress and Tunnel Vision:** As stress rises (fear of crashing), your peripheral vision physically collapses. You literally lose the ability to see the "big picture."

### 3. The Music Connection

You are absolutely right that this applies to music. In music pedagogy, this is often called **"Audiation"** or **"Looking Ahead."**

If you stare at the note you are currently playing, you are reacting to the present moment. If you make a mistake and focus on it (the "pebble"), you stop the flow.
*   **The Technique:** Virtuoso musicians do not look at the note they are playing; they look at the *next* measure. They are mentally hearing the "horizon" of the phrase.
*   **The Flow State:** To maintain flow, you must accept the mistake (the bump in the road) without locking your gaze on it.

### 4. Deliberate Practice: How to Train the "Horizon Gaze"

You asked for deliberate practice techniques that span domains. Here is how to train this reflex:

**A. The "Soft Focus" Drill (Visual)**
*   **Motorcycling/Driving:** Practice looking as far down the road as possible. Use your peripheral vision to monitor the immediate road surface. This separates "focal vision" (the horizon) from "ambient vision" (the road/pebbles).
*   **Music:** Practice reading two beats ahead of your hands. If you miss a note, force yourself to keep your eyes moving forward on the sheet music. Never look back.

**B. The "Recovery" Drill (Psychological)**
*   **Simulation:** Deliberately induce small failures. In music, improvise and play a "wrong" note, then practice resolving it into a correct one without stopping the rhythm.
*   **Goal:** You are desensitizing your brain's alarm response to the "pebble" so you don't freeze when it happens for real.

### 5. Navigating Life: The Psychology of the Horizon

Your intuition that this applies to depression and anxiety is supported by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

*   **The Pebble:** A negative thought, a regret, or a specific fear.
*   **Target Fixation in Life:** If you wake up and focus entirely on "I am tired" or "I am worried about this meeting," your psychological steering locks onto that negativity. You end up having the bad day you feared because you were staring at it.
*   **The Horizon:** Your values, your long-term goals, or a sense of purpose.

**The Skill to Practice:**
When you feel yourself spiraling (locking onto the pebble), use a physical "interrupt." Physically lift your head, look at the horizon (or the sky), and ask: *"Where am I trying to go?"* rather than *"What am I afraid of hitting?"*

### 6. Faith and Prayer: A Concrete Definition

This is your most striking insight. If we strip away the mystical abstraction of "Faith" and "Prayer," they map perfectly onto the concept of **Counter-Instinctual Focus.**

**The Analogy of Peter Walking on Water**
There is a biblical story that fits your film scene perfectly. Peter steps out of a boat to walk on water toward Jesus (The Horizon). As long as he looks at Jesus, he stays above the water. The moment he looks down at the wind and the waves (The Pebbles/Trees), he begins to sink.
*   **Faith is not magic; Faith is Focus.** Faith is the disciplined refusal to stare at the immediate danger and the conscious choice to stare at the ultimate destination.
*   **Prayer as Calibration:** In this context, prayer isn't just "asking for things." Prayer is the daily practice of lifting your eyes from the "pebbles" (bills, arguments, stress) to re-align with the "horizon" (God, Love, Peace, The Good).

**Concrete "Faith" Practice:**
You asked how to develop this "strength or reflex."
1.  **Acknowledge the Pebble:** "I see this problem/fear."
2.  **Inhibit the Reflex:** "I will not stare at it."
3.  **Shift the Gaze:** "I will look toward the solution/outcome I desire."

**Summary**
The grandfather in *Mirai* was teaching the boy a universal rule of survival. Whether you are on a bike, playing a sonata, fighting off depression, or practicing faith, the rule is the same: **You go where you look.** The discipline lies in training yourself to look at the destination, even when the obstacles are screaming for your attention.
