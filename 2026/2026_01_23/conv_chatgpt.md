# Prompt 1
Can you give me a fairly detailed history and timeline of the Australian national anthem?
Who wrote and composed it and do we have any documented evidence of their political views?
The title 'Advance Australia Fair' seems a bit weird? Like could it actually mean "Advance 'white' Australia" as in 'fair skinned'?
Do any of the lyrics or politics of the author acknowledge Australias rich pre-european history?
Was the 'white australia policy' ever officially called that? What names did it actually go by?
Could you give me a phrase by phrase breakdown and analysis of the two verses of the anthem (I think the second one starts with 'beneath or radiant southern cross' - are there any other known verses?)... for each phrase could you give me an alternative phrase that I might be able to sing along instead that will make me feel more comfortable?
For example the first line "Australian's all let us rejoice, for we are young and free" ... the 'young' part doesn't really speak to the enormous and rich history of human occupation of the continent and the 'free' part seems almost bitterly ironic because indigenous australians are incredibly over-represented in australian prisons.
I've always thought that Aretha Franklin's song 'get it right' might be a nice inspiration for some new lyrics because the message is very uplifting even though it acknowledges past mistakes.
It would be so great to be able to sing along to the tune of the anthem but with lyrics that are much more meaningful to me.

## 🇦🇺 **History & Timeline of _Advance Australia Fair_**

**1878 — Composition**  
• Written and composed (words and music) by **Peter Dodds McCormick**, a Scottish-born Australian teacher and church musician who published under the pen name _Amicus_ (“friend”). It was first performed on **30 November 1878 in Sydney** at a Highland Society event. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair"))

**1901 — Federation Ceremonial Performance**  
• An amended version was sung by a choir of about 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia — reinforcing its patriotic role long before it was the official anthem. ([Craig Hill](https://craighill.net/2021/11/30/on-this-day-australia-in-1878-advance-australia-fair-was-first-sung-publicly/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "On this day (Australia): In 1878, Advance Australia Fair was first sung publicly – Craig Hill"))

**1907 — Government Recognition**

**1974–1976 — Competing Anthems**  
• It briefly replaced _God Save the Queen_ as the national anthem in 1974.  
• In 1976, the Fraser government reinstated _God Save the Queen_ for royal occasions and listed four “national songs” — including _Advance Australia Fair_, _Waltzing Matilda_, and _Song of Australia_ — for other use. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair"))

**1977 — Plebiscite**  
• A nationwide poll chose _Advance Australia Fair_ as the preferred national song (not yet the anthem). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair"))

**1984 — Official Anthem**  
• The Hawke government proclaimed _Advance Australia Fair_ the official **national anthem** with revised lyrics (two verses). _God Save the Queen_ remained the **royal anthem**. ([PM&C](https://www.pmc.gov.au/honours-and-symbols/australian-national-symbols/australian-national-anthem?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Australian National Anthem | PM&C"))

**2021 — Lyrics Updated**  
• In an effort toward inclusion and recognizing Indigenous history, the line “For we are _young_ and free” was officially changed to “For we are _one_ and free”.

## 🎼 **About the Composer: Peter Dodds McCormick**

• McCormick (1833–1916) was a **schoolteacher**, church musician and active community figure in Sydney. ([adb.anu.edu.au](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mccormick-peter-dodds-7323?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Peter Dodds McCormick - Australian Dictionary of Biography"))  
• There is **no strong documented evidence** that he explicitly articulated a detailed political ideology or wrote publicly about race or immigration policy (including the _White Australia_ ideas of the time).

## 🏳️‍🌈 **Does the Anthem Reflect _White Australia_ or Indigenous History?**

### ❌ _Was “Advance Australia Fair” intended to mean “Advance white Australia”?_

The title **does not explicitly mean “advance fair-skinned Australians.”** It reflects a 19th-century poetic style where _“fair”_ meant _“beautiful, splendid”_ — similar to many British patriotic phrases of the time. There’s **no direct linguistic evidence** that McCormick meant _“fair-skinned”_ specifically. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair"))

However — and this is important — the anthem _does not acknowledge_ the deep history of First Nations peoples in Australia, as it refers to the nation as _“young”_ (now _“one”_) and celebrates _“those who’ve come across the seas”_. Historically, anthem lyrics emerged during a colonial context where indigenous histories were largely **ignored** in mainstream narratives. ([EBSCO](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/music/advance-australia-fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair | Research Starters - EBSCO"))

### 🧠 The _White Australia Policy_ Context

The _White Australia policy_ wasn’t a single named law — it was a **series of racially discriminatory immigration laws** designed to restrict non-European immigration. The main legal foundation was the **Immigration Restriction Act 1901**, and other related acts (like the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901) gave effect to the broader policy. ([National Museum of Australia](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/white-australia-policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com "White Australia policy | National Museum of Australia"))

So yes, _“White Australia policy”_ is a real label for the **suite of laws and attitudes**, though Australia never had _one official law titled exactly that_. ([historyandheritage.cityofparramatta.nsw.gov.au](https://historyandheritage.cityofparramatta.nsw.gov.au/blog/2017/01/30/the-white-australia-policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The 'White Australia' Policy | Parramatta History and Heritage"))

These policies were in place until progressively dismantled between the late 1940s and early 1970s.

## 🧠 Why Many People Criticize the Anthem

Some Australians feel the anthem:  
• **doesn’t fully acknowledge Indigenous history** (Australia’s human history spans at least ~65,000 years) — this was a reason for the 2021 lyric change. ([Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/australia-changes-national-anthem-nod-indigenous-people-180976673/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Australia Changes National Anthem Lyrics to Recognize Its Long Indigenous History"))  
• Contains _colonial-era sentiments_ that focus on _settlers_ rather than First Nations peoples or those brought forcibly to this land.  
• Uses older poetic language that feels distant to many today. ([ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-27/why-everyone-think-australian-national-anthem-flawed/8565134?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Why does everyone think 'Advance Australia Fair' is flawed? - ABC News"))

There are movements and alternative versions (like community-created lyrics and proposals like _I Am Australian_) that cover broader stories and identities not present in the current anthem. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Australian?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Am Australian"))

## 🧾 Short Summary

**Advance Australia Fair** was written in 1878 as a patriotic song by Peter Dodds McCormick, and became the official national anthem in 1984 after public polls and government decisions. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advance Australia Fair")) Its lyrics were modernized more than once, most recently in 2021 to remove “young” to acknowledge Indigenous connection to place. ([PM&C](https://www.pmc.gov.au/honours-and-symbols/australian-national-symbols/australian-national-anthem?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Australian National Anthem | PM&C")) The anthem’s language reflects its 19th-century origins and does not explicitly engage with Australia’s colonial history or pre-European human habitation — something many Australians continue to debate and reinterpret. ([ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-27/why-everyone-think-australian-national-anthem-flawed/8565134?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Why does everyone think 'Advance Australia Fair' is flawed? - ABC News"))

## 🪶 A Suggestion
