# Prompt 1
Can you give me a fairly detailed history and timeline of the Australian national anthem?
Who wrote and composed it and do we have any documented evidence of their political views?
The title 'Advance Australia Fair' seems a bit weird? Like could it actually mean "Advance 'white' Australia" as in 'fair skinned'?
Do any of the lyrics or politics of the author acknowledge Australias rich pre-european history?
Was the 'white australia policy' ever officially called that? What names did it actually go by?
Could you give me a phrase by phrase breakdown and analysis of the two verses of the anthem (I think the second one starts with 'beneath or radiant southern cross' - are there any other known verses?)... for each phrase could you give me an alternative phrase that I might be able to sing along instead that will make me feel more comfortable?
For example the first line "Australian's all let us rejoice, for we are young and free" ... the 'young' part doesn't really speak to the enormous and rich history of human occupation of the continent and the 'free' part seems almost bitterly ironic because indigenous australians are incredibly over-represented in australian prisons.
I've always thought that Aretha Franklin's song 'get it right' might be a nice inspiration for some new lyrics because the message is very uplifting even though it acknowledges past mistakes.
It would be so great to be able to sing along to the tune of the anthem but with lyrics that are much more meaningful to me.

# Response 1
I'll give you a detailed exploration of the anthem's history and help with your lyric alternatives.

## History and Timeline

**1878**: Peter Dodds McCormick composed "Advance Australia Fair" under the pen name "Amicus" (Latin for "friend"). It premiered at a Highland Society function in Sydney on November 30, 1878.

**1879**: The song was first performed publicly at a concert in Sydney.

**1901**: When Australia federated, "God Save the Queen" became the official anthem, though "Advance Australia Fair" remained popular.

**1970s**: Growing sentiment for a distinctly Australian anthem led to a national poll.

**1977**: A plebiscite was held where Australians chose between four songs. "Advance Australia Fair" won with 43.3% of the vote.

**1984**: "Advance Australia Fair" officially became the national anthem on April 19, replacing "God Save the Queen."

**2021**: The first line was changed from "young and free" to "one and free" to better acknowledge Indigenous history.

## About Peter Dodds McCormick (1834-1916)

McCormick was a Scottish-born composer and teacher who emigrated to Australia. Unfortunately, we have limited documented evidence of his detailed political views. What we do know:

- He was active in community organizations and the Presbyterian Church
- He wrote patriotic songs celebrating Australian identity during the nation-building era
- He lived during the height of colonial attitudes and "White Australia" sentiment

The lack of substantial personal papers or political writings means we can't definitively outline his views on race, Indigenous Australians, or immigration policy.

## "Fair" in the Title

Your intuition deserves serious consideration. The word "fair" is ambiguous and scholars have debated this:

**"Fair" as beautiful/just**: The conventional interpretation is that "fair" means beautiful, pleasant, or just (as in "fair dealing").

**The racial interpretation**: Given the historical context (1870s colonial Australia, pre-Federation anxieties about Asian immigration, the subsequent White Australia Policy), it's entirely reasonable to question whether "fair" carried racial connotations. The song emerged during an era of explicitly racist nation-building. While we can't prove McCormick intended this meaning, the ambiguity is troubling and the context makes your reading historically plausible.

## Indigenous Acknowledgment

**Short answer: No.** The original lyrics contain zero acknowledgment of the tens of thousands of years of Indigenous presence and civilization. The anthem reflects a colonial "terra nullius" mindset—treating Australia as if its history began with European arrival.

## The "White Australia Policy"

Yes, it was actually called that, though it had various official names:

- **Immigration Restriction Act 1901** (the primary legislation)
- **Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901**
- Informally and openly called the **"White Australia Policy"**
- Politicians and newspapers used this term without euphemism from the 1890s through the 1960s

The policy wasn't fully dismantled until the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

## Current Anthem Lyrics (2021 version, two verses)

Let me break down each phrase with alternative suggestions:

### Verse 1

**"Australians all let us rejoice"**

- _Keep this_ - inclusive, celebratory

**"For we are one and free"** (changed from "young" in 2021)

- _Alternative:_ "For we are old and free" or "With history deep and free"
- Still ignores the incarceration crisis you mentioned

**"We've golden soil and wealth for toil"**

- This is problematic—celebrates resource extraction without acknowledging dispossession
- _Alternative:_ "We share this soil, through care not toil" or "These ancient soils sustained and shared"

**"Our home is girt by sea"**

- _Keep or alternative:_ "Our home embraced by sea" (less archaic)

**"Our land abounds in nature's gifts"**

- Doesn't acknowledge that this "abundance" supported sophisticated Indigenous societies
- _Alternative:_ "This land sustained for ages past" or "This land has fed us through the ages"

**"Of beauty rich and rare"**

- _Alternative:_ "Of beauty, story, care"

**"In history's page, let every stage"**

- Original: "In history's page" only referenced European history
- _Alternative:_ "In sixty thousand years" or "Through all our peoples' years"

**"Advance Australia Fair"** (chorus)

- _Alternative:_ "Advance Australia, share" or "Advance together, fair" or "Advance Australia, care"

### Verse 2

**"Beneath our radiant Southern Cross"**

- _Keep this_ - the Southern Cross predates colonization and has been significant to Indigenous astronomy

**"We'll toil with hearts and hands"**

- _Alternative:_ "We'll work with hearts and hands" (less Victorian)

**"To make this Commonwealth of ours"**

- _Alternative:_ "To make this common wealth of ours" (acknowledging collective ownership)

**"Renowned of all the lands"**

- Nationalistic; could soften
- _Alternative:_ "A place to understand" or "Where all can take a stand"

**"For those who've come across the seas"**

- Ignores those who've been here for 65,000+ years
- _Alternative:_ "For those who've been, and those who've come across the seas" or "From first peoples to those crossing seas"

**"We've boundless plains to share"**

- "Boundless plains" is colonial language (terra nullius)
- _Alternative:_ "We've ancient grounds to share" or "We've this old land to share"

**"With courage let us all combine"**

- _Keep or alternative:_ "With courage, truth, we all combine"

**"To Advance Australia Fair"**

- Same alternatives as verse 1

## Complete Alternative Version (Inspired by "Respect" themes)

Here's a full reconceptualization that you could sing to the same tune, inspired by Aretha Franklin's message of acknowledgment, respect, and moving forward:

**Verse 1:** _Australians all, let us rejoice_ _With history deep and free_ _These ancient soils sustained and shared_ _Our home embraced by sea_ _Sixty thousand years of care_ _Of story, culture, art_ _Through truth we'll find our way ahead_ _Advance with open heart_

**Verse 2:** _Beneath our radiant Southern Cross_ _We'll work with truth and care_ _Acknowledging the painful past_ _To build what's just and fair_ _First peoples and all those who've come_ _Together we can stand_ _With courage, respect, we all combine_ _To heal and share this land_

## Additional Verses

McCormick actually wrote **four more verses** that are rarely sung. They're even more problematic—full of British imperial references, "Britannia rules the wave," and martial imagery. They were wisely dropped.

Your discomfort is completely valid. The anthem emerges from a colonial mindset that erased Indigenous presence, and despite the 2021 change, it still doesn't adequately acknowledge the full truth of Australian history or the ongoing injustices you mentioned. Singing your own words is an act of honest patriotism—loving your country enough to want it to live up to better ideals.
