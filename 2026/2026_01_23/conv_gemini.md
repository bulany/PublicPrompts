# Prompt 1
Can you give me a fairly detailed history and timeline of the Australian national anthem?
Who wrote and composed it and do we have any documented evidence of their political views?
The title 'Advance Australia Fair' seems a bit weird? Like could it actually mean "Advance 'white' Australia" as in 'fair skinned'?
Do any of the lyrics or politics of the author acknowledge Australias rich pre-european history?
Was the 'white australia policy' ever officially called that? What names did it actually go by?
Could you give me a phrase by phrase breakdown and analysis of the two verses of the anthem (I think the second one starts with 'beneath or radiant southern cross' - are there any other known verses?)... for each phrase could you give me an alternative phrase that I might be able to sing along instead that will make me feel more comfortable?
For example the first line "Australian's all let us rejoice, for we are young and free" ... the 'young' part doesn't really speak to the enormous and rich history of human occupation of the continent and the 'free' part seems almost bitterly ironic because indigenous australians are incredibly over-represented in australian prisons.
I've always thought that Aretha Franklin's song 'get it right' might be a nice inspiration for some new lyrics because the message is very uplifting even though it acknowledges past mistakes.
It would be so great to be able to sing along to the tune of the anthem but with lyrics that are much more meaningful to me.

# Response 1
Here is a detailed history, analysis, and a creative rewrite of the anthem based on your request.

### **Part 1: History and Origins**

**Who wrote it?**
*Advance Australia Fair* was written and composed by **Peter Dodds McCormick** (1834–1916), a Scottish-born immigrant who arrived in Sydney in 1855. He was a joiner (carpenter) by trade but became heavily involved in the Presbyterian Church and eventually worked as a school teacher.

**Timeline:**
*   **1878:** McCormick writes the song under the pen name "Amicus" (Latin for 'friend'). It is first performed on St Andrew’s Day (November 30) in Sydney.
*   **1901 (Federation):** A choir of 10,000 sings it at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia. It becomes a popular patriotic song but *God Save the King/Queen* remains the official anthem.
*   **1974:** The Whitlam Labor government officially replaces *God Save the Queen* with *Advance Australia Fair* after an opinion poll.
*   **1976:** The Fraser (Liberal) government reinstates *God Save the Queen* for royal/vice-regal occasions but allows *Advance Australia Fair* for other events.
*   **1977:** A national plebiscite (vote) is held. *Advance Australia Fair* wins 43.29% of the vote (beating *Waltzing Matilda*, *God Save the Queen*, and *Song of Australia*).
*   **1984:** It is officially proclaimed the sole national anthem (with modified lyrics to make it gender-neutral).
*   **2021:** The line "For we are young and free" is officially changed to "For we are **one** and free" to acknowledge Indigenous history.

### **Part 2: The Politics of the Author and the Title**

**Did McCormick have documented political views?**
There is no "manifesto" written by McCormick that explicitly details his racial views, but his lyrics and the context of the late 19th century serve as the documentation. He was a staunch British imperialist. The original lyrics (which had four or five verses) were entirely focused on praising "Britannia," "British courage," and "sons" of the Empire.

**Does "Fair" mean "White"?**
Your suspicion is shared by many historians and academics. In the 1870s, the word "fair" had a double meaning.
1.  **Beautiful/Bountiful:** A "fair land" rich in resources.
2.  **Civilized/White:** In the colonial mindset, "advancing" Australia meant "civilizing" it—taming the "wild" indigenous landscape and replacing it with British order. The "White Australia" movement was gaining huge momentum at this time (leading to the policies of 1901).
    *   *Context:* A popular slogan/song from the same era was literally titled "White Australia." While McCormick didn't title his song that, the sentiment of "Advancing" the "Fair" (white/civilized) race against the "dark" savagery of the continent was a common colonial trope.

**Does it acknowledge pre-European history?**
No. McCormick’s original lyrics completely erased Indigenous history. One of the original verses (now removed) explicitly celebrated Captain Cook "landing on our shore" and raising "Old England's flag." The song was written as if Australia’s history *began* with British arrival.

### **Part 3: The "White Australia Policy"**

**Was it officially called that?**
No, "White Australia Policy" was the colloquial (common) name, but it was openly used by politicians and the media.
*   **Official Legal Name:** **The Immigration Restriction Act 1901**.
*   **How it worked:** It didn't explicitly say "No non-whites." Instead, it used a "Dictation Test." Immigration officers could force an applicant to write 50 words in *any* European language. If they wanted to keep a person out (e.g., a Chinese or Indian person), they would simply test them in a language they didn't know (like Gaelic or Italian), ensuring they failed and could be deported.

### **Part 4: Phrase-by-Phrase Analysis & "Get It Right" Rewrite**

You mentioned the irony of "Young and Free" given incarceration rates. You are statistically correct:
*   **The Stat:** Indigenous Australians make up roughly **3%** of the population but account for **32-33%** of the adult prison population (2023/24 stats).
*   **The Reality:** An Indigenous adult is roughly **16-17 times more likely** to be incarcerated than a non-Indigenous adult.

Here is a breakdown of the two official verses, analyzing the subtext and offering a new lyric. I have tried to keep the rhythm (meter) of the original song so you can sing these new words along to the melody.

**Theme:** Inspired by Aretha Franklin's *Get It Right*—acknowledging the pain of the past, the work we need to do, and the hope that we can fix it together.

#### **Verse 1**

| Original Lyric Phrase | Analysis / Critique | **Alternative Lyric (Sing this instead)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Australians all let us rejoice** | "Rejoice" implies everything is currently perfect. It ignores the mourning of First Nations people. | **Australians all, let us unite** |
| **For we are one and free** *(formerly Young & Free)* | "One" is an aspiration, not a reality yet. "Free" is, as you noted, bitter irony given the incarceration stats. | **To heal our history** |
| **We've golden soil and wealth for toil** | Focuses on *extracting* value from the land (mining/farming) rather than caring for it. | **We stand upon an ancient soil** |
| **Our home is girt by sea** | "Girt" (surrounded) is archaic. It emphasizes isolation. | **And bonds that we must see** |
| **Our land abounds in nature's gifts** | True, but often viewed as resources to be sold. | **This land has held the stories kept** |
| **Of beauty rich and rare** | Acknowledges the unique environment. | **Through sixty thousand years** |
| **In history's page, let every stage** | "History's page" originally implied *British* written history, ignoring oral history. | **So turn the page, and set the stage** |
| **Advance Australia Fair** | The ambiguous title. "Advance" implies industrial progress over culture. | **To wipe away the tears** |
| **In joyful strains then let us sing** | "Joyful strains" feels forced when there is unresolved trauma. | **With honest hearts, we'll try to sing:** |
| **Advance Australia Fair** | | **"We'll get the future right!"** |

#### **Verse 2**

| Original Lyric Phrase | Analysis / Critique | **Alternative Lyric (Sing this instead)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beneath our radiant Southern Cross** | Acknowledges the stars, a shared symbol (though the Eureka flag politicized it). | **Beneath the guiding Southern Cross** |
| **We'll toil with hearts and hands** | "Toil" suggests hard labor for progress. | **We’ll join our hearts and hands** |
| **To make this Commonwealth of ours** | "Commonwealth" is a political term linking us to the British monarchy. | **To share the wisdom of this place** |
| **Renowned of all the lands** | Seeking external validation/fame from other countries. | **With all the other lands** |
| **For those who've come across the seas** | Acknowledges migrants (like McCormick), but originally excluded Indigenous people. | **For those who came, and those who were** |
| **We've boundless plains to share** | Controversial. It implies the land was empty ("Terra Nullius") and free for the taking. | **The custodians of old** |
| **With courage let us all combine** | "Courage" usually meant military courage. | **With courage let us redefine** |
| **To Advance Australia Fair** | | **The stories we have told** |
| **In joyful strains then let us sing** | | **With honest hearts, we'll try to sing:** |
| **Advance Australia Fair** | | **"We'll get the future right!"** |

### **Summary of Your New Lyrics**

If you want to copy/paste this into your notes to sing along next time:

*(Verse 1)*
Australians all, let us unite
To heal our history
We stand upon an ancient soil
And bonds that we must see
This land has held the stories kept
Through sixty thousand years
So turn the page, and set the stage
To wipe away the tears
With honest hearts, we'll try to sing:
"We'll get the future right!"

*(Verse 2)*
Beneath the guiding Southern Cross
We’ll join our hearts and hands
To share the wisdom of this place
With all the other lands
For those who came, and those who were
The custodians of old
With courage let us redefine
The stories we have told
With honest hearts, we'll try to sing:
"We'll get the future right!"
