# Prompt 1
Imagine if "forgiveness" or "forgiving" is a "skill" or "muscle"... like just like I can develop the ability to do 10 push ups in a row, even if I can barely do 1 push up to start with I can gradually work at this skill or ability and be fairly confident that I will reach the 10 push ups in a row goal.
What if forgiving people, myself and things were the same thing... and the reason I'm not so good at it is that I don't practice.
When I've actually tried to think about forgiving someone I actually find it really hard because I don't know where to start. Like I often think "well I could never forgive them for that because they've done that thing and that's all there is to it". I wonder if in this case I'm starting with a bar that's too high. 
I also think I could just say in my head "I forgive you", but I know I don't really believe that... I'm just saying the words. I possibly don't know what it means to truly forgive someone because I have never tried (or don't seem to try often). 
Is there any literature or study around this subject? Like could you give me some arguments to whether or not forgiving is actually a "skill"?
If it is a skill, could the principles of deliberate practice also apply to the process of forgiving?
What are the real concrete steps involved in forgiving someone.
Like it seems like there might have to be some acknowledgement from the other person or some understanding of the harm they have caused... maybe I shouldn't say 'harm', maybe I should say the effect they have had (on me).
I think a barrier to forgiveness might be the fear that the person will repeat the behaviour... are there other barriers to forgiveness? Has this stuff been studied?
I guess I want a kind of beginners guide to forgiving and a concrete daily routine (low intensity, high consistency... say 2 minutes a day) that I might try and apply to improve my capacity and ability to forgive.
Oh and here's a bonus question: imagine I'm a skeptic about the 'benefits' or concrete value of the skill of forgiveness... could you think up any kind of thought experiment (or practical experiment) that I could try that would convince me one way or the other?

# Response 1
This is a really thoughtful line of inquiry. You’re not being vague or “self-help-y” here — you’re basically asking whether _forgiveness can be treated like a trainable capacity_, what the mechanics are, and whether the training actually _does anything useful_. That’s a very respectable level of skepticism.

I’ll try to answer this in layers, starting from research and theory, then getting concrete, then ending with a practical experiment you could actually run.

---

## 1. Is forgiveness a “skill” or “muscle”?

**Short answer:** Many psychologists treat it _exactly_ like that — a learnable, practice-dependent capacity — though they usually call it a _process_ or _ability_ rather than a muscle.

### What the literature says (high level)

There are several well-established research programs here:

- **Robert Enright** (University of Wisconsin–Madison): Developed one of the first _process models of forgiveness_ and ran controlled studies showing people can be taught to forgive and that their capacity improves with practice.
    
- **Everett Worthington** (Virginia Commonwealth University): Developed the **REACH** model of forgiveness, explicitly designed as a _trainable intervention_.
    
- **Fred Luskin** (Stanford): Focuses on forgiveness as an _emotion regulation skill_, closely tied to stress physiology.
    

Across these frameworks, forgiveness is **not treated as a personality trait you either have or don’t**. It’s treated as:

- a **set of cognitive moves** (how you interpret what happened),
    
- a **set of emotional skills** (how you relate to resentment, anger, grief),
    
- and a **behavioral choice** (what stance you take going forward).
    

That maps _very cleanly_ onto how we talk about skills.

---

## 2. Your push-up analogy is surprisingly accurate

You’re absolutely right about the “starting bar being too high.”

Many people think forgiveness means:

> “I no longer feel hurt, angry, or changed by what happened.”

That’s like defining “being able to do push-ups” as:

> “I can do 50 perfect push-ups with no shaking.”

No wonder it feels impossible.

In the research, forgiveness is usually defined much more modestly:

> **Forgiveness = a gradual reduction in hostile thoughts, emotions, and motivations toward someone who caused harm, _without excusing or denying the harm_.**

Notice what’s _not_ required:

- Forgetting
    
- Reconciliation
    
- Trust
    
- Letting it happen again
    
- Feeling warm or loving
    

This is where the “skill” framing helps:  
**early reps are ugly, shaky, and partial — and they still count.**

---

## 3. “I could never forgive them” is not a conclusion — it’s a starting point

What you’re describing here is very common and very important:

> “They did _that thing_, and that’s all there is to it.”

From a skills perspective, that sentence is not a moral stance — it’s a **frozen narrative**. Forgiveness practice often starts by _loosening_ the narrative, not replacing it.

A beginner-level move is **not**:

> “I forgive them.”

It’s more like:

- “I am not ready to forgive this.”
    
- “Part of me is open to _eventually_ not carrying this forever.”
    
- “I don’t know what forgiveness would even mean here.”
    

These are **valid early reps**.

---

## 4. Does deliberate practice apply?

Yes — but with some modifications.

Classic deliberate practice has four components:

1. **Small, well-defined actions**
    
2. **Low difficulty, high repetition**
    
3. **Feedback**
    
4. **Progressive overload**
    

Forgiveness training fits this surprisingly well:

|Deliberate practice|Forgiveness equivalent|
|---|---|
|Small reps|Micro-forgiveness (very low-stakes annoyances)|
|Repetition|Daily reflection|
|Feedback|Emotional intensity decreases / faster recovery|
|Progressive overload|Gradually harder cases|

Most people fail because they start with **max-load emotional deadlifts**.

---

## 5. Concrete steps involved in forgiving (as a process)

Synthesizing Enright, Worthington, and emotion-regulation research, forgiveness usually involves **four separable steps**. You do _not_ need to do them all at once.

### Step 1: Naming the impact (not minimizing it)

This matches what you intuitively said.

Key distinction:

- ❌ “They harmed me” (moral framing)
    
- ✅ “This had these effects on me” (psychological framing)
    

Examples:

- “I became more guarded.”
    
- “I lost trust.”
    
- “I replay it in my head.”
    
- “It changed how I see myself.”
    

This step _prevents fake forgiveness_.

---

### Step 2: Separating accountability from inner burden

This is a big one.

Forgiveness is **not**:

> “What they did is okay.”

It _is_:

> “Carrying this resentment is costing me something.”

That cost might be:

- mental bandwidth
    
- emotional energy
    
- bodily tension
    
- shortened fuse elsewhere
    

Forgiveness practice begins when the **cost becomes more salient than the moral verdict**.

---

### Step 3: Adjusting your stance, not your feelings

This is subtle but crucial.

You don’t aim to change how you _feel_.  
You aim to change what you **intend to do with the feelings**.

Beginner-level intentions:

- “I will not rehearse this story tonight.”
    
- “I don’t need to reach a final verdict today.”
    
- “I choose not to escalate this internally.”
    

That’s already forgiveness practice.

---

### Step 4: Optional — humanizing without excusing

This comes later, not first.

Humanizing means:

- Seeing them as a psychologically caused agent
    
- Not seeing them as _only_ the worst thing they did
    

This does **not** mean:

- trusting them
    
- liking them
    
- staying close to them
    

This step is often impossible early on — and that’s fine.

---

## 6. Barriers to forgiveness (yes, very studied)

You already identified a major one:

### Fear of repetition

This is huge. Many people unconsciously equate forgiveness with:

> “Lowering my defenses.”

In healthy forgiveness, **boundaries usually increase**, not decrease.

Other common barriers:

- **Identity protection** (“If I forgive, I’m saying I deserved it.”)
    
- **Moral loyalty** (“If I forgive, I betray my past self.”)
    
- **Justice confusion** (forgiveness vs consequences)
    
- **Emotional payoff** (anger as energy or clarity)
    
- **Ambiguous harm** (no clear apology or acknowledgment)
    

Importantly:  
**Forgiveness does not require the other person’s participation.**  
Reconciliation does.

---

## 7. A 2-minute-a-day beginner routine (very doable)

Here’s a deliberately _low-intensity_ practice.

### Daily “Forgiveness Micro-Rep” (2 minutes)

**Minute 1 — Pick something tiny**  
Not the big trauma.  
Choose:

- a minor annoyance
    
- something that flared briefly today
    
- something that keeps replaying at 2/10 intensity
    

Ask:

> “What effect did this have on me?”

Name _one_ effect.

---

**Minute 2 — Shift stance by 5%**  
Complete one of these sentences:

- “I don’t need to resolve this today.”
    
- “I can let this rest for the next hour.”
    
- “I choose not to replay this tonight.”
    
- “I can hold this without feeding it.”
    

That’s it. Stop.

This trains **capacity**, not conclusions.

Over weeks, you’ll notice:

- faster emotional recovery
    
- less rumination
    
- more choice about where attention goes
    

That’s the “strength gain.”

---

## 8. A skeptic’s experiment (this is the fun part)

Here’s a clean, almost scientific test you can run.

### The 30-Day A/B Experiment

For 30 days, do this:

- **Condition A (for one recurring grievance):**
    
    - Every time it comes up, _fully indulge_ the resentment.
        
    - Rehearse the story.
        
    - Justify it.
        
    - Strengthen it.
        
- **Condition B (for a different recurring grievance):**
    
    - Apply the 2-minute forgiveness micro-practice.
        
    - No positive reframing.
        
    - Just reduced rehearsal.
        

### Measure only three things:

1. **How often it pops up**
    
2. **How intense it feels**
    
3. **How long it hijacks your attention**
    

No belief change required.

If forgiveness is bullshit, both conditions should be equal — or A should feel better.

Most people find B quietly frees up surprising amounts of mental energy. That’s the _instrumental_ value.

---

## 9. Final thought

The deepest reframe here is this:

> Forgiveness is not something you _arrive at_.  
> It’s something you _practice not making worse_.

Just like push-ups.

If you want, next we could:

- design a **forgiveness “progression plan”** (like reps and sets),
    
- look at **self-forgiveness specifically** (it’s a different beast),
    
- or unpack **one concrete example** and walk it through the steps.
    

You’re asking exactly the right questions.

## Prompt 2
Ok this all sounds pretty reasonable. What about 'role models' or 'inspirations'... with other disciplines like sports we can always point to a few hero's and heavy weights. If forgiveness is a skill, who holds the current emotional deadlift record? Can you give me a list of five contendors?

# Response 2
Ha — “the emotional deadlift record” is a _great_ phrase 😄  
I like this question because it forces us to be concrete instead of floating in abstractions.

One quick framing move before the list, though, because it matters:

There is **no single leaderboard** for forgiveness the way there is for lifting or sprinting. Different people lifted _different kinds of weight_:

- public vs private harm
    
- one-time acts vs ongoing oppression
    
- interpersonal betrayal vs systemic violence
    
- forgiving _without_ reconciliation vs forgiving _with_ it
    

So instead of “the strongest,” think **different weight classes and lifts**. With that in mind, here are five very serious contenders.

---

## 1. Nelson Mandela — _The max-weight, long-duration hold_

**Lift:** 27 years of imprisonment → political reconciliation  
**Why he’s on the list:** This is probably the heaviest _publicly verifiable_ forgiveness feat on record.

Mandela emerged from prison without seeking revenge, and instead:

- invited former enemies into governance,
    
- explicitly framed forgiveness as _strategic and moral_,
    
- resisted enormous pressure to retaliate.
    

Important nuance:  
Mandela did **not** deny harm, forget, or skip accountability. He supported truth-telling (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) _before_ forgiveness.

**What makes this elite-level skill, not sainthood:**

- He spoke openly about _training himself_ not to hate.
    
- He framed resentment as something that would _continue the imprisonment_.
    

That’s textbook “forgiveness as self-liberation,” not moral posturing.

---

## 2. Viktor Frankl — _The internal, no-witness lift_

**Lift:** Forgiveness without power, justice, or closure  
**Why he’s on the list:** He practiced forgiveness **entirely internally**, under extreme conditions.

As a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, Frankl didn’t forgive specific perpetrators in a sentimental way — instead, he:

- refused to let suffering dictate his inner stance,
    
- emphasized meaning-making over resentment,
    
- described forgiveness as a _freedom of attitude_.
    

His move was radical:

> “They can take everything except how I choose to relate to this.”

That’s forgiveness stripped down to **pure agency**, with no applause and no reconciliation.

---

## 3. The Amish community of Nickel Mines — _The speed record_

**Lift:** Immediate forgiveness after extreme violence  
**Why they’re on the list:** In 2006, after a school shooting killed five Amish girls, the community:

- publicly forgave the shooter within days,
    
- supported the shooter’s family,
    
- refused retaliatory narratives.
    

This is controversial, and rightly so. But as a _skill demonstration_, it’s extraordinary.

Key point:  
This wasn’t spontaneous emotion — it was **pre-trained forgiveness**.  
They had a culture of _daily low-intensity reps_, which allowed a high-intensity response.

That maps exactly onto your “deliberate practice” idea.

---

## 4. Desmond Tutu — _The facilitator’s lift_

**Lift:** Holding others’ unforgiveness without collapsing into it  
**Why he’s on the list:** Tutu wasn’t just forgiving personally — he was **coaching forgiveness at scale**.

As chair of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he:

- absorbed others’ rage and grief daily,
    
- insisted on truth before forgiveness,
    
- framed forgiveness as a way to avoid being “trapped in the past.”
    

This is a different muscle entirely:

> Forgiving _while staying emotionally open_ to other people’s pain.

That’s like lifting heavy _and_ spotting someone else at the same time.

---

## 5. Fred Luskin (the quiet pro) — _The reproducibility champion_

**Lift:** Making forgiveness teachable and repeatable  
**Why he’s on the list:** Not the most dramatic story, but arguably the most _important_ for your framing.

Luskin:

- operationalized forgiveness into small cognitive steps,
    
- showed it could be trained in ordinary people,
    
- demonstrated measurable reductions in stress, anger, and rumination.
    

This is like turning elite Olympic technique into a beginner program that actually works.

If forgiveness is a skill, Luskin helped write the **Starting Strength** manual.

---

## Honorable mentions (different lifts, still impressive)

- **Eva Mozes Kor** — forgave Nazi doctors who experimented on her as a child (deeply controversial, deeply personal).
    
- **Gordon Wilson** — forgave the IRA bomber who killed his daughter _on live TV_.
    
- **Thich Nhat Hanh** — forgiveness as moment-to-moment mindfulness practice.
    

---

## One last important calibration

None of these people:

- forgave instantly _without training_,
    
- confused forgiveness with forgetting,
    
- suggested forgiveness is mandatory or owed.
    

What they share is this:

> **They treated resentment as something that could be worked with, not obeyed.**

That’s the core of the “skill” framing.

If you want, next we could:

- analyze **one of these figures using the 4-step model** from earlier,
    
- design a **“forgiveness progression ladder”** (beginner → intermediate → advanced),
    
- or look at **anti-role-models** — cases where _not forgiving_ was adaptive.
    

Just say the word.
