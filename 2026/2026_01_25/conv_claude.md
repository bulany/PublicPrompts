Imagine if "forgiveness" or "forgiving" is a "skill" or "muscle"... like just like I can develop the ability to do 10 push ups in a row, even if I can barely do 1 push up to start with I can gradually work at this skill or ability and be fairly confident that I will reach the 10 push ups in a row goal.
What if forgiving people, myself and things were the same thing... and the reason I'm not so good at it is that I don't practice.
When I've actually tried to think about forgiving someone I actually find it really hard because I don't know where to start. Like I often think "well I could never forgive them for that because they've done that thing and that's all there is to it". I wonder if in this case I'm starting with a bar that's too high. 
I also think I could just say in my head "I forgive you", but I know I don't really believe that... I'm just saying the words. I possibly don't know what it means to truly forgive someone because I have never tried (or don't seem to try often). 
Is there any literature or study around this subject? Like could you give me some arguments to whether or not forgiving is actually a "skill"?
If it is a skill, could the principles of deliberate practice also apply to the process of forgiving?
What are the real concrete steps involved in forgiving someone.
Like it seems like there might have to be some acknowledgement from the other person or some understanding of the harm they have caused... maybe I shouldn't say 'harm', maybe I should say the effect they have had (on me).
I think a barrier to forgiveness might be the fear that the person will repeat the behaviour... are there other barriers to forgiveness? Has this stuff been studied?
I guess I want a kind of beginners guide to forgiving and a concrete daily routine (low intensity, high consistency... say 2 minutes a day) that I might try and apply to improve my capacity and ability to forgive.
Oh and here's a bonus question: imagine I'm a skeptic about the 'benefits' or concrete value of the skill of forgiveness... could you think up any kind of thought experiment (or practical experiment) that I could try that would convince me one way or the other?

# Response 1
This is a fascinating and genuinely insightful reframing. The idea that forgiveness is a developable skill rather than a binary state you either achieve or don't is very much supported by psychological research.

## Is Forgiveness Actually a Skill?

**Yes, and here's the evidence:**

Research by Robert Enright (often called the "father of forgiveness studies") and colleagues has shown that forgiveness can be deliberately cultivated through structured interventions. Their work demonstrates that people can measurably improve their capacity to forgive through practice, much like any other psychological skill.

The key arguments supporting forgiveness as a skill:

**Neuroplasticity evidence**: Brain imaging studies show that forgiveness involves cognitive processes (perspective-taking, emotional regulation, empathy) that we know can be strengthened through practice. These aren't fixed capacities.

**Intervention effectiveness**: Meta-analyses of forgiveness interventions show consistent, significant improvements. If forgiveness were purely a gift of temperament or circumstance, structured practice wouldn't reliably increase it.

**Componential nature**: Forgiveness involves discrete, learnable components—recognizing harm, managing emotions, perspective-taking, choosing to release resentment. Each can be practiced independently.

**Cultural variation**: Forgiveness capacity varies significantly across cultures with different practices and values around it, suggesting it's learned rather than innate.

Your insight about the bar being too high is particularly astute. Enright's research identifies this as a common barrier—people attempt to forgive severe betrayals before developing the capacity with smaller grievances.

## Barriers to Forgiveness (From Research)

Studies identify several key obstacles:

**Fear of repetition**: Exactly what you mentioned. People confuse forgiveness with trust or reconciliation. Forgiveness is about your internal state; trust is earned through changed behavior. You can forgive someone and still maintain boundaries.

**Belief it condones the action**: The misconception that forgiving means saying "it was okay." It doesn't—it means "I'm choosing to release the grip this has on me."

**Identity investment**: Sometimes resentment becomes part of how we see ourselves or our relationship with someone. Letting go feels like losing part of our story.

**Lack of acknowledgment**: You're right that this matters, though research shows forgiveness is possible even without apology. It's harder, but the practice can still work.

**Confusion about what forgiveness is**: Many people, as you noted, don't actually know what the internal experience should feel like.

## Concrete Daily Practice (2 Minutes)

Here's a graduated, evidence-based approach:

**Week 1-2: Micro-forgiveness practice**

- Each day, identify one tiny annoyance (someone cut you off in traffic, a friend was 5 minutes late, you burned your toast)
- Spend 2 minutes: Notice the irritation in your body. Acknowledge it's real. Then consciously think "I'm letting this go. It doesn't serve me to hold this." Notice if the tension shifts even slightly.
- This builds the basic neural pathway of release without high stakes.

**Week 3-4: Self-forgiveness ladder**

- Pick a small personal regret (said something awkward, forgot a task, ate too much dessert)
- 2 minutes: Write or think "I did [X]. It wasn't my best moment. I'm human and learning. I forgive myself for this."
- Focus on the feeling of extending compassion to yourself, like you would to a friend.

**Week 5-6: Third-person perspective**

- Choose a minor grievance with someone else
- 2 minutes: Imagine explaining what happened to a neutral observer. What might have been going on for the other person? What need were they trying to meet, even if clumsily?
- Not excusing them—just seeing them as a full human who makes mistakes.

**Week 7-8: The release statement**

- For a moderate-sized hurt (not your biggest one yet)
- 2 minutes: Write or say "What [person] did affected me. It hurt. I don't have to forget it or pretend it didn't happen. But I'm choosing to release my need for them to suffer for it. This is for my peace, not theirs."
- Notice: forgiveness isn't a feeling that arrives fully formed. It's a choice you may need to remake multiple times.

## What Forgiveness Actually Involves (The Real Steps)

Based on Enright's process model and subsequent research:

1. **Acknowledgment of harm**: You can't forgive what you haven't admitted hurt you. This means feeling the anger, pain, or betrayal—not skipping to "it's fine."
    
2. **Decision to forgive**: This is distinct from the feeling. It's choosing to work toward release even while still feeling hurt.
    
3. **Working on understanding**: Not to excuse, but to see the other person as complex—their wounds, pressures, limitations. This often naturally softens resentment.
    
4. **Accepting the reality**: What happened, happened. You can't change it. You can only choose your relationship to it going forward.
    
5. **Releasing the claim**: Consciously letting go of the expectation that the person should suffer or compensate you. This is the hardest part and often happens gradually.
    

Importantly, none of this requires:

- The other person to apologize
- Reconciliation or restored relationship
- Forgetting what happened
- Being okay with what they did

## A Practical Experiment for the Skeptic

**The Split-Test Week**:

Choose two similar minor-to-moderate grievances you're currently holding (maybe two friends who both flaked on plans, or two small betrayals of trust).

- **Grievance A (Control)**: Do nothing. Continue as normal with your usual thoughts about it.
- **Grievance B (Experiment)**: Spend 2 minutes daily for one week practicing release: "They did this thing. It affected me. I'm choosing to work on letting go of my resentment about it."

After seven days, compare:

- How much mental space does each grievance occupy?
- How much does each affect your mood when triggered?
- How much energy are you spending on each?
- What's your stress level when you think about each person?

The hypothesis: Grievance B should feel lighter, occupy less mental real estate, and drain less energy—even if the behavior was equally bad and even if neither person apologized. If forgiveness has no value, there should be no difference.

**What this tests**: Whether the _practice_ of releasing resentment (regardless of whether it's "deserved") has measurable effects on your wellbeing. That's the actual value proposition of forgiveness—not moral virtue, but practical mental freedom.

The beautiful thing about your muscle analogy is that it's more accurate than you might realize. With push-ups, you don't start by doing your max—you start with wall push-ups or knee push-ups. With forgiveness, you don't start with the person who most deeply betrayed you. You start with the person who was mildly thoughtless last Tuesday. And just like with push-ups, some days you'll have more capacity than others, and that's completely normal.

The fact that saying "I forgive you" feels hollow is actually a good sign—it means you're being honest with yourself about where you actually are in the process. Real forgiveness is built through smaller, genuine releases, not through forcing yourself to feel something you don't.

# Prompt 2
Ok this all sounds pretty reasonable. What about 'role models' or 'inspirations'... with other disciplines like sports we can always point to a few hero's, virtuosos and heavy weights. If forgiveness is a skill, who holds the current emotional deadlift record? Can you give me a list of five contendors?

# Response 2
What a brilliant question. This really tests whether we're talking about a genuine skill or just a vague virtue. Here are five contenders for the "emotional deadlift record":

## 1. **Immaculée Ilibagiza** (Rwandan Genocide Survivor)

**The lift**: During the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Immaculée hid in a 3x4 foot bathroom with seven other women for 91 days while genocidaires hunted for them. Her entire family was murdered—her mother, father, and two brothers were killed with machetes. After emerging, she eventually came face-to-face with the man who killed her mother and brother.

**The forgiveness**: She forgave him. Not in some abstract, distant way—she visited him in prison, told him she forgave him, and touched his hands. She describes the process in her book _Left to Tell_: it took months of prayer and internal work, and she describes it as the hardest thing she ever did. She says she felt physically lighter afterward, like a weight had been removed.

**Why she's a contender**: The sheer magnitude of the loss and brutality, combined with the direct, personal nature of the forgiveness. She also describes her _method_—specific practices of prayer, perspective-taking, and repeated choice—which supports the skill framework.

## 2. **Eva Kor** (Auschwitz Survivor)

**The lift**: Eva and her twin sister Miriam were subjected to Josef Mengele's medical experiments at Auschwitz as children. Her parents and older sisters were murdered in the gas chambers. She carried physical and psychological scars for decades.

**The forgiveness**: In 1995, at a commemoration at Auschwitz, she publicly read a declaration of forgiveness for the Nazis. This was monumentally controversial—many survivors felt she had no right to forgive on behalf of the dead. But Eva was clear: "I forgave the Nazis not because they deserve it, but because I deserve peace." She later met and befriended a former Nazi doctor, Hans Münch, who had worked at Auschwitz.

**Why she's a contender**: She forgave without any apology, remorse, or acknowledgment from most perpetrators (many were dead). She explicitly framed forgiveness as _self-liberation_—a practical tool, not a moral stance. She also spent the rest of her life teaching others how to forgive, suggesting she genuinely understood it as a technique.

## 3. **Thích Nhất Hạnh** (Vietnamese Zen Master)

**The lift**: During the Vietnam War, Thích Nhất Hạnh lost students, colleagues, and saw his country devastated. His School of Youth for Social Service—which rebuilt bombed villages—was caught between both sides of the war. Members were killed by both communist and anti-communist forces. He was exiled from Vietnam for 39 years for his peace activism.

**The forgiveness**: He practiced and taught what he called "deep listening" and "loving speech" even toward those who had caused immense suffering. He wrote about forgiving the pirate who raped a young girl on a refugee boat—not the act, but the person, understanding the pirate's own suffering and conditioning. He advocated for reconciliation between Vietnamese people and Americans while memories were still fresh.

**Why he's a contender**: He developed and taught _systematic methods_ for cultivating forgiveness—specific meditation practices, breathing techniques, perspective-taking exercises. He treated it explicitly as a skill with a training regimen. The fact that he created reproducible practices that others could follow is strong evidence for the skill model.

## 4. **Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix** (Joined by Shared Tragedy)

**The lift**: In 1995, 20-year-old Azim's son Tariq, a college student delivering pizzas, was shot and killed by 14-year-old Tony Hicks in a gang initiation. Ples Felix was Tony's grandfather and guardian.

**The forgiveness**: Within months, Azim reached out to Ples. Rather than blame each other, they recognized they'd both lost their boys—one to murder, one to prison. They founded the Tariq Khamisa Foundation together to work on gang violence prevention. When Tony was released from prison after 25 years, Azim embraced him. The three now work together.

**Why he's a contender**: Azim documented his process carefully—he talks about the specific moment he made the decision to forgive (six weeks after the murder), the practices he used (meditation, reframing, choosing to see Tony as a victim of societal violence too), and how it changed over time. The fact that he moved from forgiveness to _collaboration_ with the grandfather of his son's killer is an extraordinary demonstration of the skill's practical application.

## 5. **Marina Cantacuzino** (The Forgiveness Project Founder)

**The lift**: This one's a bit different. Marina isn't famous for forgiving a single massive harm to herself. Instead, she spent 20 years collecting and documenting stories of people who've forgiven extreme harms—terrorism, murder, rape, torture, genocide.

**Why she's a contender**: She's essentially the **researcher/coach of the field**. Through hundreds of interviews, she's identified patterns in how people actually achieve forgiveness. Her work shows that forgiveness isn't random or mystical—there are common practices, stages, and methods. If forgiveness is a skill, she's like the person who studied all the Olympic weightlifters to understand the biomechanics. Her book _Radical Forgiveness_ and The Forgiveness Project archive are essentially the field's training manual.

**What's remarkable across all these cases:**

- None of them say forgiveness happened instantly or easily
- All describe it as a _process_ with specific practices
- Most emphasize that forgiveness was for their own liberation, not the perpetrator's benefit
- Several went on to teach their methods to others, suggesting they understood it as transferable skill
- None of them forgot or condoned what happened
- Most maintained that justice and accountability were still important

If you want to watch the "film footage" of these lifts, I'd suggest:

- Eva Kor's TEDx talk "Surviving the Angel of Death"
- The documentary _As We Forgive_ (about Rwandan reconciliation, featuring people with stories similar to Immaculée's)
- Any interview with Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix together—watching them interact is striking

The fact that we _can_ point to exemplars, that they describe methods, and that others have learned from them—that's pretty strong evidence for the skill framework.
