# Prompt 1
I'm going to go on a long car trip in a car that has an aux cable input to the stereo (no bluetooth).
I want to find a solution whereby I can have a fairly small battery powered device (a bit like and old iPod) that has a screen and a fairly easy way to navigate a fairly large library of audio files that are a mix of music mp3s and longer form audio books and podcasts. 
I want it to be as fairly low cost as possible. Ideally using found or second hand hardware or maybe something I've already got like an old android phone or an old iphone.
A couple of ideas I wonder about are: using an old or second hand phone with an sd card slot, it has an audio jack and maybe even bluetooth... and maybe I can buy some kind of really cheap battery powered bluetooth reciever that I leave plugged into the aux cable in the car. That way the phone or mp3 player can be like a wireless remote and people in the back seat can easily pause or restart the recording... or pick their favourite song.
Other ideas... some kind of cheap and awesome thing on Aliexpress that when I order it, I'm surprised by the quality and price and think "wow why didn't I know about this before and order it"... again, essential features would be 'sd card slot/spot, audio jack output, long battery life, and fairly intuitive library navigation' and other awesome features would be 'bluetooth capabale'
Can you give me some of your best ideas on what might satisfy my 'wants' and can you also sort of summarise and surmise what I'm getting at into what would be an awesome prompt for an llm to get the information and seeking. Maybe do that summary and prompt idea first (like basically assess this prompt and analyse it and then reformulate it and then have a go at giving me what I'm after) thanks!

## Analysis & Reformulated Prompt

**What you're really asking for:**
A budget-friendly, portable audio solution for car trips that:
- Works with aux cable (no car bluetooth)
- Handles large mixed libraries (music + audiobooks/podcasts)
- Has good navigation/screen for browsing
- Ideally enables wireless control from back seat
- Prioritizes: low cost, long battery, intuitive UX, SD card expansion

**Key insight:** You're torn between two approaches:
1. **Wired simple**: Dedicated device plugged into aux
2. **Wireless split**: Device stays in front, cheap bluetooth receiver on aux cable for back-seat control

**Reformulated prompt for an LLM:**
> "I need a car audio solution for aux-only stereo. Budget-conscious using existing/secondhand hardware. Must handle large mixed libraries (music, audiobooks, podcasts) with good navigation. Core requirements: SD card support, headphone jack, long battery, intuitive UI. Bonus: bluetooth capability. Two approaches I'm considering: (1) all-in-one device that stays plugged in, or (2) phone/player + cheap bluetooth aux receiver for wireless back-seat control. What are the best secondhand devices, repurposed tech, or surprising AliExpress finds that fit these needs?"

## My Recommendations

### **Best Overall: Old Android Phone (2017-2020 era)**
**Why this wins:**
- **Free/cheap**: Old phones ($20-50 secondhand) often have everything you need
- **SD card slot**: Many Samsung, LG, Motorola models support 128GB-512GB cards
- **Headphone jack**: Still common in 2017-2019 Androids (Samsung Galaxy S9, LG G7, Moto G series)
- **Bluetooth built-in**: Enables your back-seat wireless idea
- **Battery**: Can stay plugged into 12V USB adapter, or works 8-12hrs on battery
- **Apps**: Use purpose-built apps like:
  - **Smart AudioBook Player** (best audiobook navigation)
  - **Poweramp** (music with folder browsing)
  - **VLC** (plays everything, simple folders)
  - **Musicolet** (lightweight, offline, no internet needed)

**Specific models to hunt for:**
- Samsung Galaxy S8/S9 (headphone jack, microSD)
- LG G6/G7/V30 (headphone jack, quad DAC = great audio)
- Moto G6/G7 Plus (cheap, headphone jack, SD card)

**Setup**: Remove SIM, disable updates, airplane mode + wifi off = no distractions, just media

---

### **Your Bluetooth Aux Receiver Idea = Brilliant**
**Recommended cheap receiver:** 
- **1Mii B06 Plus** (~$20-25) - 15hr battery, aux out, clip design
- **Anker Soundsync** (~$18) - reliable, 12hr battery
- **Generic USB-powered Bluetooth aux adapter** (~$8-12 on AliExpress) - stays plugged into car's USB for power

**Why this combo rocks:**
- Phone/player stays with passengers → easy control
- Receiver stays plugged in → no fumbling with cables
- Range: 30ft easily covers car interior
- Latency negligible for music/podcasts

---

### **AliExpress Surprise Option: RUIZU/BENJIE MP3 Players**
**Models to search:**
- **RUIZU D20/D22** (~$25-35)
- **BENJIE S5** (~$20-30)
- **Surfans F20** (~$40-50, higher end)

**What you get:**
- ✅ SD card slot (up to 256GB typically)
- ✅ Headphone jack (some have surprisingly good DACs)
- ✅ 30-50 hour battery life
- ✅ Physical buttons (easier in car than touchscreen)
- ✅ Folder browsing + playlists
- ❌ Usually no bluetooth (except Surfans F20)

**The "wow" factor:** Build quality and battery life often exceed expectations at this price

---

### **Dark Horse: Old iPod Classic + SD Card Mod**
If you're moderately handy:
- Buy broken iPod Classic ($20-40)
- Replace HDD with SD card adapter (~$10)
- Install Rockbox firmware (free, open-source)
- **Result**: 256GB+ storage, legendary UI, 40+ hour battery, iconic

---

## My Top Pick for You:

**Old Android phone (Galaxy S9 or LG G7) + cheap bluetooth aux receiver**

**Why:**
- Total cost: $30-70 (phone $20-50, receiver $10-20)
- Phone has screen for navigation, SD card for library, bluetooth for wireless
- Receiver stays in car, phone travels with passengers
- Use Smart AudioBook Player for audiobooks (remembers position, variable speed)
- Use Poweramp or Musicolet for music (folder view, no need for tagging)
- Back-seat passengers control playback wirelessly
- Phone can also handle navigation if needed

**Setup time:** 30 minutes to load apps and transfer files

This gives you the flexibility, features, and "wireless remote" capability you described, all for the price of a couple of coffees.

   - Originally clothing, now has electronics
   - Buyer protection, cheaper than BackMarket
   - Shipping available, less sketchy than Leboncoin

4. **eBay.fr**
   - International sellers + French ones
   - Good for rare models like LG G7/V30
   - Check seller ratings carefully

## **Physical Stores:**

5. **CeX (Computer Exchange)**
   - UK chain with French stores (Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse)
   - Test before buying, 24-month warranty
   - Prices higher than Leboncoin but safer
   - Website: fr.webuy.com

6. **Cash Converters**
   - Several locations across France

## **Tips for Buying:**

- **Leboncoin strategy:** Offer 10-15% less than asking price, most sellers expect negotiation
- **Check battery health:** Settings > Battery > Battery Health (if available), or use AccuBattery app at meetup
- **Headphone jack test:** Bring earbuds, test aux output
- **SD card slot:** Bring a microSD card to test read/write
- **Screen condition:** Less critical for car use, negotiate down if scratched

## **Best Search Terms:**

French Leboncoin searches:

---

**My recommendation for you specifically:** Start with **Leboncoin** searching for **Samsung Galaxy S9** in "Bon État" for €40-60. Abundant supply, proven reliability, meets all your needs. If you find an **LG G7** under €70, grab it for the superior audio. Only go Moto G7 if you're truly budget-constrained under €40.

# Prompt 3
Ok this is all great to know but I think its all a bit out of my budget.
I don't really want to spend more than 40 euros and all those options are more like 100 euros.
This phone is available new from Auchan for 25 euros: https://www.auchan.fr/qilive-telephone-big-screen-noir/pr-C1840283
(a Qilive phone)... I think it has an SD slot (max card size 32GB which is actually plenty for me) and it runs android.
Could something like this run Lineage OS and if not, why not.
I don't know if it has a 3.5mm jack output
But basically I would like to spend around this much - if I can get a much better option for similar money in a second hand phone I would consider it... I don't think I have a problem with brands like Oppo etc
At carrefour I see they have many 'connected watches' (e.g. Yonis brand) in the 20 - 30 euro range. Could any of these be fully customised with something like Lineage OS? I guess they probably wouldn't have a 3.5mm jack, but maybe an SD slot? Or maybe they have around 30-60GB storage which would be enough for me and with the bluetooth adapter that's going to be fine?
Carrefour have Yonis and ZTE smartphones for about 60 euros - what do you think of these?
Yeah I just realised I could really drop the SD card slot requirement if the phone has over 30GB storage... I guess the phone would work almost like an SD card right, just a big sd card but would probably be easier because I don't even know if I have an SD card reader on hand at the moment.

# Reality Check Time

Okay, let's recalibrate for your **€25-40 budget** and address these options realistically:

---

## **The Qilive Phone from Auchan (€25)**

**Quick answer:** This will likely frustrate you. Here's why:

**What it probably is:**
- Ultra-budget Android Go phone (stripped-down Android for weak hardware)
- Probably 1GB RAM, very slow processor (MediaTek MT6580 or similar)
- Likely 8GB internal storage (with Android taking ~5GB = you get 3GB for apps/music)
- Screen probably 5" low-res
- **Uncertain if it has headphone jack** - budget phones are 50/50 on this
- 32GB SD card max is limiting but workable

**LineageOS? No.**
- LineageOS requires:
  - Unlockable bootloader (budget brands lock these)
  - Developer community support (no one develops for €25 phones)
  - Decent hardware (minimum 2GB RAM really)
- **Qilive phones have ZERO custom ROM support** - it's a white-label brand, no development community

**Why not:**
- Too slow for comfortable navigation of large libraries
- Laggy UI will annoy you on long trips
- No headphone jack = you'd need USB-C to aux adapter (if it even supports audio out)
- Can't be customized/debloated
- Likely terrible battery life (small cheap battery)

**Verdict:** Skip it. This is a "emergency burner phone" not a media device.

---

## **Smart Watches (Yonis, €20-30)**

**Hard no.**

- Tiny screens (unusable for browsing music library)
- No headphone jacks
- Storage is tiny (4-8GB typical, mostly filled by OS)
- No SD card slots
- Can't run LineageOS (different architecture, proprietary OS)
- Bluetooth range/battery wouldn't work for car use

**Verdict:** Completely wrong tool for the job.

---

## **Carrefour ZTE/Yonis Smartphones (€60)**

**Still not great, but better than Qilive:**

- Similar issues: locked bootloaders, no custom ROM support, weak specs
- ZTE *might* have 2GB RAM and better processor
- €60 is creeping toward secondhand territory where you get WAY more value

**Verdict:** If you're going to €60, buy secondhand instead (see below).

---

# What You SHOULD Do at €25-40 Budget

## **Option 1: Secondhand Phone (Revised for Your Budget)**

---

## **Option 2: Dedicated MP3 Player (New from AliExpress)**

Since you dropped the SD requirement and 30GB+ is fine:

### **AGPTEK A02 / RUIZU D02** - €15-25 shipped
- ✅ Headphone jack (obviously)
- ✅ 8-16GB internal (fits your needs)

**Why consider:** Dirt cheap, does ONE thing well, insane battery life

**Downside:** Screen navigation not as nice as phone, no bluetooth option

---

## **Option 3: Your Bluetooth Adapter Idea + Old Phone You Already Have**

**Do you have ANY old phone at home?**
- Old iPhone 5/6? (€0 if you own it)
- Old Android from 2015+? (€0 if you own it)
- Friend's drawer phone? (€0 if borrowed)

**+ Cheap bluetooth aux adapter:** €8-15 on Amazon/AliExpress

**Why this might be best:**
- Free phone you already own
- Cheap bluetooth receiver
- Total cost: €8-15
- You get the wireless back-seat control you wanted

---

# My Honest Recommendation for €25-40

## **Best value: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 or Moto G5 on Leboncoin for €30-40**

**Why:**
- Headphone jack ✓
- MicroSD slot ✓
- Good battery ✓
- Actually runs music apps smoothly ✓
- LineageOS support if you want to tinker ✓
- **Proven devices with millions sold = lots available secondhand**

**How to find:**
1. Leboncoin.fr
2. Search "Xiaomi Redmi Note 4" or "Moto G5"
3. Filter: €20-50, "Téléphones" category
4. Look for "État Correct" or "Bon État"
5. Message sellers: "Bonjour, est-ce que le prix est négociable? Je peux faire €30."
6. Meet in public, test headphone jack + SD slot

**Realistic finds right now on Leboncoin:**
- Redmi Note 4: €35-45 typical
- Moto G5: €25-40 typical
- Samsung J7: €20-35 typical

---

## **If You Want New (Not Secondhand):**

**Skip Qilive/Yonis/cheap Carrefour brands entirely.**

Instead, watch for:
- **Xiaomi Redmi 9A/9C** - sometimes on sale €60-70 (headphone jack, SD slot, decent specs)
- **Nokia C-series** - €50-70 range, clean Android, reliable

But honestly, **€60 new gets you worse specs than €35 secondhand flagship from 2017-2018**.

---

# Storage Reality Check

You said 30GB+ is fine without SD card. Let's check:

**How much fits in 30GB:**
- ~6,000 songs (5MB each, high quality MP3)
- OR ~20 full audiobooks (1.5GB each, unabridged)
- OR ~30 podcast series (1GB each)
- OR mix: 3,000 songs + 10 audiobooks + some podcasts

**Phone internal storage reality:**
- "32GB phone" = ~25GB usable (OS takes space)
- "16GB phone" = ~10GB usable = too tight

**So you need:**
- Phone with 32GB+ internal, OR
- Phone with 16GB + microSD slot

---

# Final Answer

**Don't buy the Qilive phone.** It will disappoint you.

**Do this instead:**
1. Spend 30 minutes on Leboncoin searching "Xiaomi Redmi Note 4", "Moto G5", "Samsung J7"
2. Find one for €30-40 in "État Correct"
3. Meet seller, test headphone jack with your earbuds
4. Load it up with music apps (VLC, Poweramp trial, Musicolet - all free)
5. Optionally buy €10 bluetooth aux adapter later if you want wireless

**Total: €30-40 for phone, done.**

Or tell me: **do you have ANY old smartphone at home already?** Even a cracked-screen iPhone 6 or ancient Android would work better than that Qilive phone and cost you €0.

# Prompt 4
Could you give me a quick tutorial on the Samsung galaxy naming, lineage and timeline e.g. I just want to understand the difference between the A3 - J3 - S3 S9... maybe you could just tabulate them in terms of when they came out... maybe just keep it to the ones that are really quite interesting for my project (e.g. the A3 and the S9 (high end option)). Because I'm not familiar with their naming convention I just want to know if I see an 'S5' (if that exists) in the window of a second hand store for a good price, should I snap it up or steer clear of it and keep hunting for an A3?
