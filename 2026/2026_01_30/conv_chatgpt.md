# Prompt 1
"En vous souhaitent une année 2025 lumineuse" (with photo of a pretty sunlit path in the forest)
"En souhaitant que vous trouviez vos propres chemins en 2024" (with a photo of a beautiful path through the forest)
"En vous souhaitant des moment de sérenite... Bonne Année 2023" (with a photo of an old stone arch bridge over a creek)

These are all examples of new years messages I have sent in the past. I'm about to send this years photo and message. I've kind of happened on a little formula like that I like. I don't know if the french quite makes sense but I kind of like that way of trying to say the things. I've decided on the photo for this year which is an ocean sunset where you see only the water and the sky meeting and potentially some small islands in the very distance. 
I picked that shot because I want to send a message like: "En vous souhaitent une large vision en 2026" or "En vous souhaitent une vision tres large en 2026" or something similar to try and get across this idea of "keep looking at the horizon and try to avoid 'target fixation'"... on making the analogy that navigating through life (e.g. in 2026) might be a bit like riding a motorbike and when you ride a motorbike you have to be careful to always 'look where you want to go'... if you get 'target fixated' on a small rock or a scary looking tree on the side of the road you might end up driving right into it because you couldn't look away. With the image I would like to try and remind people (and myself) of this idea and philosophy... its a very broad perspective shown... its vast and there are no real details to 'focus' on but on the whole the image is quite serene and peaceful. What do you think of my suggestions for the caption or do you have any other great ideas? My intention in sending the photo and message is like a prayer for myself and all the people I send it to.

# Response 1
I really like this ritual you’ve built. It _does_ read like a quiet prayer, and the consistency of “photo + slightly poetic wish” gives it a signature. The ocean horizon fits that philosophy beautifully — wide, calm, no distractions, just direction.

A small but important French note first (because you said you weren’t sure):  
👉 it’s **“En vous souhaitant”** (present participle), not _souhaitent_.  
You’ve already been very close every time 🙂

Now, about the _idea_ you want to convey — wide vision, horizon, avoiding target fixation — that absolutely works, but I think we can make it sound a little more natural and poetic in French, while keeping your understated style.

### Your current ideas

- **« En vous souhaitant une large vision en 2026 »**  
    ✔️ Understandable  
    ❌ Slightly abstract / a bit technical-sounding
    
- **« En vous souhaitant une vision très large en 2026 »**  
    ✔️ Clear  
    ❌ “très large” feels a bit literal, almost like a camera setting
    

They’re not _wrong_, but French tends to like metaphor more than explanation — especially for wishes.

### Some alternatives that lean into the horizon idea 🌅

**Very close to your original, but softer:**

- **« En vous souhaitant une vision plus large en 2026 »**
    
- **« En vous souhaitant de garder une vision large en 2026 »**
    

**More poetic / horizon-focused (my strong favorites):**

- **« En vous souhaitant de toujours garder l’horizon en vue en 2026 »**  
    → This _perfectly_ matches the motorcycle metaphor without explaining it.
    
- **« En vous souhaitant un regard tourné vers l’horizon en 2026 »**  
    → Gentle, contemplative, very “photo + wish”.
    
- **« En vous souhaitant une année 2026 tournée vers l’horizon »**  
    → Slightly less about “vision”, more about direction in life.
    

**Serenity + vastness (fits the calm ocean):**

- **« En vous souhaitant une année 2026 vaste et apaisée »**
    
- **« En vous souhaitant l’espace et le calme en 2026 »**
    

**Subtly philosophical, still simple:**

- **« En vous souhaitant de voir loin en 2026 »**  
    Short, elegant, and very French.
    

### If I had to pick _one_ that best matches your intention

If your goal is _avoid fixation, keep moving toward where you want to go_, without over-explaining:

> **« En vous souhaitant de toujours garder l’horizon en vue en 2026 »**

It’s:

- visual
    
- metaphorical
    
- calm
    
- and works beautifully with an ocean sunset
    

It also reads exactly like the kind of sentence someone might pause on for a second — which feels right for a New Year’s wish.

If you want, you can tell me:

- who you’re sending this to (friends / family / colleagues / mixed), or
    
- whether you want it _more poetic_ or _more minimal_
    

and I can fine-tune it to be _exactly_ your voice.

# Prompt 2
Ok how about?
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargies en 2026"
Is there any gramatical, spelling or other issues with that one?

# Response 2
Nice instinct — that sentence is _almost_ perfect, and the idea lands really well 👍  
There’s just **one small grammatical issue**:

👉 **“horizons” is masculine plural**, so the adjective must agree.

### Corrected version

> **« En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026 »**

### Why this works well

- **“horizons”** → plural = many possible paths, futures, perspectives
    
- **“élargis”** → metaphorical, poetic, very natural in French
    
- The whole phrase sounds intentional and elegant, not translated
    

If I received that with an ocean horizon photo, I’d immediately get:

- breadth of vision
    
- openness
    
- calm forward-looking energy
    

It absolutely fits your ongoing “visual prayer” tradition.

If you want _microscopic_ stylistic variants (not corrections, just flavor):

- **« …des horizons toujours plus larges en 2026 »** (a bit more hopeful)
    
- **« …des horizons ouverts en 2026 »** (softer, very serene)
    

But as it stands:

✅ Grammatically correct  
✅ Natural French  
✅ Poetic without being heavy

You’re good to send it 🌊✨

# Prompt 3
Great! I settled on...
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"
Would you have any reccommendations on font choice? Avenir was selected before which looks pretty good - maybe I should just go with that but I don't really know anything about typefaces and fonts.

# Response 3
That caption is a really good final choice — calm, open, and confident. Nicely done.

On fonts: you’re right that **Avenir** works very well here, and there’s a good reason it _feels_ right even if you don’t know typography. Let me give you a bit of intuition rather than theory.

---

## Short answer (if you want to stop thinking)

👉 **Stick with Avenir.**  
It fits the photo, the message, _and_ your existing tradition. Consistency across years is a quiet kind of elegance.

---

## Why Avenir works so well for this series

Avenir is:

- **Humanist** → feels warm and thoughtful, not corporate
    
- **Geometric but soft** → matches wide horizons and calm spaces
    
- **Timeless** → doesn’t scream “2020s design trend”
    
- **Unshowy** → the image stays the star, the text just whispers
    

For a message that’s meant to feel like a _prayer_, this is exactly right.

If you’re using it again, that actually strengthens the ritual:  
_new image, new wish, same visual voice._

### How to use Avenir (small but important tips)

- Use **Avenir Light** or **Book**, not Heavy
    
- Avoid all caps — sentence case feels more human
    
- Give it breathing room: wide margins, no crowding
    
- Slightly lower contrast (off-white rather than pure white) if the sky is bright

## If you _do_ want an alternative vibe (optional)

Only consider changing if you _want_ a subtle shift in feeling.

### 🌊 Still modern, a bit more poetic

- **Avenir Next** – basically a refined sibling, very safe
    
- **Source Sans 3** – open, calm, slightly more airy
    

### 🌅 Softer / more contemplative

- **Optima** – elegant, human, quietly spiritual
    
- **Gill Sans Light** – warm, reflective, very “letter to a friend”
    

### 🧘 Minimal / almost invisible

- **Helvetica Neue Light** – neutral, lets the horizon do all the talking  
    (This works _only_ if spacing is generous.)
    

---

## What I’d personally do (based on your description)

Ocean horizon. Serenity. No fixation. Quiet guidance.

**Avenir Light**, centered or slightly off-center, modest size, lots of negative space.

That choice says:

> “I don’t need to decorate this thought. Just notice it.”

If you want, you can tell me:

- light or dark photo overall
    
- text placement (center / bottom / corner)
    

and I’ll fine-tune weight, alignment, and spacing so it really _sits_ in the image.
