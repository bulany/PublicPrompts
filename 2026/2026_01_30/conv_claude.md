# Prompt 1
"En vous souhaitent une année 2025 lumineuse" (with photo of a pretty sunlit path in the forest)
"En souhaitant que vous trouviez vos propres chemins en 2024" (with a photo of a beautiful path through the forest)
"En vous souhaitant des moment de sérenite... Bonne Année 2023" (with a photo of an old stone arch bridge over a creek)

These are all examples of new years messages I have sent in the past. I'm about to send this years photo and message. I've kind of happened on a little formula like that I like. I don't know if the french quite makes sense but I kind of like that way of trying to say the things. I've decided on the photo for this year which is an ocean sunset where you see only the water and the sky meeting and potentially some small islands in the very distance. 
I picked that shot because I want to send a message like: "En vous souhaitent une large vision en 2026" or "En vous souhaitent une vision tres large en 2026" or something similar to try and get across this idea of "keep looking at the horizon and try to avoid 'target fixation'"... on making the analogy that navigating through life (e.g. in 2026) might be a bit like riding a motorbike and when you ride a motorbike you have to be careful to always 'look where you want to go'... if you get 'target fixated' on a small rock or a scary looking tree on the side of the road you might end up driving right into it because you couldn't look away. With the image I would like to try and remind people (and myself) of this idea and philosophy... its a very broad perspective shown... its vast and there are no real details to 'focus' on but on the whole the image is quite serene and peaceful. What do you think of my suggestions for the caption or do you have any other great ideas? My intention in sending the photo and message is like a prayer for myself and all the people I send it to.

# Response 1
I really like your tradition and the thoughtful way you connect images with wishes for the year ahead. Your French formula works beautifully as a poetic device, even if it's not strictly grammatically perfect - that gentle imperfection adds to its charm and personal character.

For your ocean sunset with the vast horizon, I think your instinct is excellent. A few thoughts:

**Your options:**

- "En vous souhaitant une large vision en 2026" - works well, though "large" might feel slightly broad/general
- "En vous souhaitant une vision très large en 2026" - similar effect

**Other possibilities that might capture your motorbike/horizon philosophy:**

- "En vous souhaitant un regard vers l'horizon en 2026" - "wishing you a gaze toward the horizon" - this feels like it captures both the looking-where-you-want-to-go and the avoiding-target-fixation ideas
    
- "En vous souhaitant de grands horizons en 2026" - "wishing you vast horizons" - plural horizons suggests many possibilities, the vastness you describe
    
- "En vous souhaitant des horizons ouverts en 2026" - "open horizons" - conveys both spaciousness and freedom from fixation
    

Given your motorbike analogy and the serene vastness of your image, I'm personally drawn to "**En vous souhaitant un regard vers l'horizon en 2026**" - because "regard" (gaze/looking) directly echoes your idea about where we direct our attention, and "vers l'horizon" captures that far, peaceful focus rather than the small scary details.

What resonates with you?

# Prompt 2
Ok how about?
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargies en 2026"
Is there any gramatical, spelling or other issues with that one?

# Response 2
Yes, there's a small grammatical issue: "horizons" is masculine, so it should be:

**"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"**

(élargis with an "s" but no "e")

That said, I want to gently point out that "élargis" (widened/broadened) feels slightly more passive or static - like horizons that have been made wider - whereas your original concept seemed more about the active choice of where to look and the natural vastness available to us.

But if "élargis" captures what you want to convey - that sense of expanded possibilities or broadened perspective - then grammatically it works perfectly with that correction.

Does that feel right to you, or would you like to explore the feeling/meaning a bit more?

# Prompt 3
Great! I settled on...
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"
Would you have any reccommendations on font choice? Avenir was selected before which looks pretty good - maybe I should just go with that but I don't really know anything about typefaces and fonts.

# Response 3
Avenir is an excellent choice and very appropriate for this kind of message! It's clean, warm, and humanist without being overly casual or too formal. If it's worked well for your previous messages, there's something nice about the consistency - it becomes part of your tradition.

That said, if you want to explore other options that would work similarly well:

**Safe, elegant choices like Avenir:**

- **Gill Sans** - similar warmth and clarity, slightly more classical
- **Futura** - geometric and modern, very clean (though slightly cooler than Avenir)
- **Proxima Nova** - contemporary, friendly, excellent readability

**If you want something slightly warmer/more personal:**

- **Brandon Grotesque** - friendly and approachable
- **Helvetica Neue Light** - classic, timeless, unobtrusive

**A subtle serif option (if you want a different feel):**

- **Garamond** or **Minion Pro** - elegant and literary, though this would be quite a departure from your previous style

Honestly though? **Stick with Avenir**. It's beautiful, it's worked for you, and that consistency across years creates a gentle visual thread through your annual messages. The words and images are what matter most, and Avenir lets them breathe without calling attention to itself.

Simple white text with perhaps a subtle shadow or gentle stroke for legibility against the ocean?
