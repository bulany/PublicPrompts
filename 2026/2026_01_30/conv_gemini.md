# Prompt 1
"En vous souhaitent une année 2025 lumineuse" (with photo of a pretty sunlit path in the forest)
"En souhaitant que vous trouviez vos propres chemins en 2024" (with a photo of a beautiful path through the forest)
"En vous souhaitant des moment de sérenite... Bonne Année 2023" (with a photo of an old stone arch bridge over a creek)

These are all examples of new years messages I have sent in the past. I'm about to send this years photo and message. I've kind of happened on a little formula like that I like. I don't know if the french quite makes sense but I kind of like that way of trying to say the things. I've decided on the photo for this year which is an ocean sunset where you see only the water and the sky meeting and potentially some small islands in the very distance. 
I picked that shot because I want to send a message like: "En vous souhaitent une large vision en 2026" or "En vous souhaitent une vision tres large en 2026" or something similar to try and get across this idea of "keep looking at the horizon and try to avoid 'target fixation'"... on making the analogy that navigating through life (e.g. in 2026) might be a bit like riding a motorbike and when you ride a motorbike you have to be careful to always 'look where you want to go'... if you get 'target fixated' on a small rock or a scary looking tree on the side of the road you might end up driving right into it because you couldn't look away. With the image I would like to try and remind people (and myself) of this idea and philosophy... its a very broad perspective shown... its vast and there are no real details to 'focus' on but on the whole the image is quite serene and peaceful. What do you think of my suggestions for the caption or do you have any other great ideas? My intention in sending the photo and message is like a prayer for myself and all the people I send it to.

# Response 1

This is a beautiful tradition. The visual of the ocean meeting the sky is perfect for the concept of "target fixation"—when you look at the vast horizon, it is impossible to fixate on a single, small obstacle.

First, a tiny but important grammatical polish. In your previous messages, you used **"En vous souhaitent"**.
*   **Correction:** The correct French grammar is **"En vous souhaitant"** (ending in **-ant**).
*   *Why:* This corresponds to the English "In wish**ing** you." (The form ending in *-ent* is for "They wish").

Here are a few options for 2026 that capture that "motorcycle philosophy" (look where you want to go, not at the bumps) while fitting your established formula.

### 1. The "Big Picture" approach (Closest to your draft)
Your idea of "une large vision" translates literally, but in French, to express the idea of seeing the whole picture rather than the small details, we often use the term *vue d'ensemble* or *grandeur*.

> **"En vous souhaitant de voir grand en 2026"**
> *(In wishing you to "see big" / think big in 2026)*

> **"En vous souhaitant une vue d'ensemble pour 2026"**
> *(In wishing you the "big picture" view for 2026)*

### 2. The "Horizon" approach (Best for the specific Photo)
Since your photo is of the water meeting the sky, using the word *horizon* is very powerful. In French, having a "dégagé" (uncluttered/open) horizon implies that you are looking forward without obstacles blocking your view—exactly the anti-target-fixation philosophy.

> **"En vous souhaitant un horizon dégagé en 2026"**
> *(In wishing you a clear/open horizon in 2026)*
> *Note: This implies: May your path be clear of obstacles so you can see far ahead.*

> **"En vous souhaitant de regarder loin en 2026"**
> *(In wishing you to look far ahead in 2026)*
> *Note: This is very similar to the motorcycle instruction. It reminds people to lift their eyes from the ground immediately in front of them and look into the distance.*

### 3. The "Serenity/Navigating" approach
If you want to lean into the metaphor of navigating a ship (since it’s an ocean photo) or a bike, these work well:

> **"En vous souhaitant de garder le cap en 2026"**
> *(In wishing you to "stay the course" / keep your heading in 2026)*
> *Note: This suggests that even if there are waves (obstacles), you keep your eyes on where you are going (the destination).*

> **"En vous souhaitant de porter votre regard vers le large..."**
> *(In wishing you to cast your gaze toward the open sea/vastness...)*
> *Note: "Le large" implies the open ocean, freedom, and space. It is the opposite of being trapped by small details.*

### Recommendation
If I were to pick the one that best matches your motorcycle analogy of "looking where you want to go" and avoiding the small rocks, while fitting the ocean photo, I would choose:

**"En vous souhaitant de regarder loin... Bonne Année 2026"**

Or, if you prefer the "Wide Vision" phrasing you originally suggested, I would tweak it slightly to be more poetic:

**"En vous souhaitant d'élargir votre horizon en 2026"**
*(In wishing you to widen your horizon in 2026)*

This suggests opening up your field of vision so you aren't focused on just one narrow, scary thing.

# Prompt 2
Ok how about?
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargies en 2026"
Is there any gramatical, spelling or other issues with that one?

# Response 2
Yes, there is one small grammatical issue with gender agreement.

The word *horizon* is **masculine** in French (*un horizon*).
The word *élargies* as you wrote it is **feminine plural** (indicated by the "e" before the "s").

To make it correct, you simply remove the "e":

> **"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"**

### Nuance Check
This phrase is grammatically perfect. In terms of meaning, **"des horizons élargis"** usually implies "broadened horizons" in the sense of discovering new things, opening your mind, or having new opportunities.

If that fits your sentiment, go for it!

However, if you want to capture the specific visual of your photo (the vastness, the serenity) and the idea of "having a lot of space/vision" rather than just "new" things, you might consider this slight variation:

> **"En vous souhaitant de vastes horizons en 2026"**

*   **Why:** *Vaste* (vast/wide) captures the sheer size of the ocean/sky image and the feeling of having plenty of room to maneuver (the anti-target fixation). It sounds very poetic and peaceful.

Both are excellent, but:
1.  **Des horizons élargis:** Focuses on *growth* and *opening up*.
2.  **De vastes horizons:** Focuses on *space*, *freedom*, and *clarity*.


# Prompt 3
Great! I settled on...
"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"
Would you have any reccommendations on font choice? Avenir was selected before which looks pretty good - maybe I should just go with that but I don't really know anything about typefaces and fonts.

# Response 3
This is a wonderful choice. **"En vous souhaitant des horizons élargis en 2026"** is grammatically flawless and carries exactly the sentiment of growth and expansive vision you are looking for.

Regarding the font: **Avenir** is actually an incredible serendipitous choice for this specific message.

Here is why you might want to keep it, along with two other options if you want a slightly different "flavor."

### 1. The Meaningful Choice: Avenir
I strongly recommend you stick with **Avenir**.
*   **The Hidden Meaning:** The word *Avenir* literally means **"Future"** in French. So, by using this font, you are inscribing your message about the new year *in* the "Future." It is a poetic layer that only you might know, but it fits your theme of "prayer/intention" perfectly.
*   **The Look:** It is a geometric sans-serif font. The "O"s are perfect circles (like the sun or a lens). It is clean, uncluttered, and essentially "dégagé" (clear)—just like the horizon you are writing about.

### 2. The "Broad" Choice: Montserrat
If you want to emphasize the "élargis" (widened/broadened) aspect of your message visually:
*   **The Look:** Montserrat is a wide, modern font. It takes up a bit more horizontal space than Avenir.
*   **Why it works:** Because the letters are wider, it subliminally reinforces the idea of width and vastness. It looks stunning in **all caps** with a little extra space between the letters.

### 3. The "Classic French" Choice: Garamond (or Cormorant)
If you want the text to feel more like a storybook, a classic prayer, or something timeless:
*   **The Look:** This is a "serif" font (it has the little feet at the ends of letters).
*   **Why it works:** It feels much more traditional and human. While Avenir feels like "clarity and modern vision," Garamond feels like "wisdom and serenity." It provides a nice contrast to a modern digital photo.

### A Pro Design Tip (The "Tracking")
Regardless of which font you choose, there is one trick designers use to make a message feel "vast" or "peaceful": **Increase the Letter Spacing.**

In your design software (or Instagram/Canva), look for "Letter Spacing" (sometimes called "Tracking") and increase it slightly.
*   Instead of `2026`, it looks like `2 0 2 6`.
*   Giving the letters "room to breathe" mimics the visual of the open ocean and the concept of a broad horizon.

**My vote:** Stick with **Avenir**. It’s clean, it’s French, and it means "Future." It’s perfect for 2026.
