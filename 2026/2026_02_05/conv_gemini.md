"C'est la nuit qu'il est beau de croire à la lumière"
Edmond Rostand (1868-1918)
This is a quote I read that I would like you to help me understand.
First of all, does the attribution seem correct?
Second can give me a general sense of the meaning? The grammar seems a little off on first reading to me "c'est la nuit..." - "it's night now"? - can you explain the construction of the sentence or give me some equivalents in english?
Third can you give me a bit of a background of Edmond Rostand? What kind of mileau did he come from? What period of history did he live in (like what big historical events was his life in the context of)?
Do we know when or where he wrote or said this? Was it part of one of his works? If so, at what period in his life was this and was the quote a reaction to something that was going on around him or in his personal life.
Was he married and did he have children? Where did he live his life? Did he practice a religion?
Are there any other questions I should be asking? Like are there any amazing stories linked to this person or this quote?

Here is a detailed breakdown of this beautiful line, the grammar behind it, and the fascinating man who wrote it.

### 1. Attribution and Source
**Yes, the attribution is correct.**
The line was written by **Edmond Rostand** (1868–1918).

It comes from his play **"Chantecler"**, published and performed in **1910**. Specifically, it is spoken by the main character (a Rooster named Chantecler) in **Act II, Scene 3**.

### 2. Meaning and Grammar
You asked about the construction *"C'est la nuit..."* because it looks like "It is night."

In French, this is a grammatical structure called a **cleft sentence** (or *mise en relief*). It is used to emphasize a specific part of the sentence. The formula is:
**C'est [X] que/qui [Y]** -> **It is [X] that [Y]**

*   **Standard sentence:** *Il est beau de croire à la lumière la nuit.* (It is beautiful to believe in the light at night.)
*   **Emphatic version (Rostand's):** *C'est **la nuit** qu'il est beau de croire à la lumière.*

**Translation:**
A literal translation would be: *"It is [during] the night that it is beautiful to believe in the light."*

However, to capture the poetic rhythm in English, you might say:
*   *"It is at night that believing in the light is most beautiful."*
*   *"It is in the darkness that faith in the light is truly beautiful."*

**The Meaning:**
The sentiment is that faith, hope, or optimism are easy when things are going well (when the sun is shining). True beauty, or true character, is found in maintaining that faith when you are surrounded by darkness (hardship, depression, or fear).

### 3. Edmond Rostand: Background and Milieu

**Who was he?**
Rostand was a contradiction to his times. He was born in **Marseille** into a wealthy, cultured, bourgeois family. His father was a prominent economist and poet. Rostand did not have to starve in a garret to become an artist; he had financial security, which allowed him to pursue his art without compromise.

**Historical Context:**
He lived during the **Belle Époque** (1871–1914), a period of peace, prosperity, and optimism in France between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I.

**Literary Context:**
This is the most important part of his identity. During this time, French theater was dominated by **Naturalism** (think Émile Zola)—plays that were gritty, realistic, depressing, and focused on social problems.
Rostand hated that. He was a **Neo-Romantic**. He wanted panache, heroism, verse, swords, and grand emotions. He single-handedly revived the romantic verse tragedy when everyone else said it was dead.

### 4. Context of the Quote: *Chantecler*

**The Work:**
This quote is the central thesis of his play *Chantecler*.
Unlike his masterpiece *Cyrano de Bergerac* (which features humans), *Chantecler* is a fable where all the characters are barnyard animals.

**The Plot:**
The protagonist, Chantecler, is a rooster who genuinely believes that **his singing causes the sun to rise**. He believes he has a divine duty to chase away the night.

**The Context of the Line:**
In Act II, Chantecler is speaking to a Pheasant hen (who represents the skeptical, modern world). She doubts him and asks why he sings when it is still pitch black, before there is any sign of dawn.
He replies with this line. He admits that he suffers from fears and doubts, but he asserts that one must sing (believe/work) *before* seeing the result. You don't believe in the light because you see it; you see it because you believed in it enough to call it forth.

**Personal Connection:**
Rostand suffered terribly from depression (neurasthenia) and "writer's block." After the global success of *Cyrano de Bergerac*, he was terrified he couldn't top it. *Chantecler* took him ten years to write. This quote likely reflects his own struggle: trying to believe in his creative "light" during his mental "darkness."

### 5. Personal Life

**Marriage:**
He was married to **Rosemonde Gérard**, a talented poet in her own right. They were a literary power couple.
*Fun Fact:* You actually know a poem by his wife, even if you don't realize it. She wrote the famous lines: *"Car, vois-tu, chaque jour je t'aime davantage, Aujourd'hui plus qu'hier et bien moins que demain"* (For you see, each day I love you more, today more than yesterday and far less than tomorrow).

**Children:**
They had two sons:
1.  **Jean Rostand:** Became a very famous biologist and philosopher.
2.  **Maurice Rostand:** Became a writer.

**Where he lived:**
Because of his poor lung health (and his need for quiet), he moved away from the bustle of Paris to the Basque Country (southwest France). He built a massive, dream-like house in **Cambo-les-Bains** called **Villa Arnaga**. It is a stunning palace with elaborate gardens that looks like a stage set.

**Religion:**
He was Catholic by tradition, but his work suggests a more mystical, idealistic spirituality rather than dogmatic religion. *Chantecler* is almost pantheistic—worshipping the sun and nature.

### 6. Other Questions & "Amazing Stories"

Here are two things that add depth to the quote and the man:

**1. The Failure of *Chantecler*:**
The quote is poignant because the play *Chantecler* was actually a bit of a disaster when it premiered. The costumes (actors dressed as chickens and dogs) looked ridiculous to the sophisticated Parisian audience, and the play was mocked. However, the text itself (including your quote) is considered a masterpiece of poetry. The quote survives even though the play failed.

**2. His Death:**
You asked about historical events. Rostand died in **1918**, not in the trenches of WWI, but during the **Spanish Flu pandemic**. He insisted on rehearsing a revival of one of his plays despite a high fever, and he collapsed. He died just weeks after World War I ended. In a way, he died just as the "night" of the war was ending and the "light" of peace was returning.

**Summary:**
The line is a defense of **Idealism**. It asserts that optimism is not naive; rather, it is a courageous act of will performed when things are at their worst.
