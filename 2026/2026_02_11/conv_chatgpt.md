# Prompt 1
I've been listening to the audiobook of "The Secret Garden" by Frances Hodgson Burnett... I'm only about halfway through so please no spoilers with whatever info you will give me.
I've been really quite delightfully surprised by this book.
It seems to be about a young girl who was initially quite horrified at the idea of being associated with the 'natives' of India, turning into a sort of Yorkshire native herself - and being very happy with it.
It seems to describe her being 'healed by country' - as she breathes the air of the moor she slowly learns to live in more "connection with country". The language used throughout the book so far reminds me somewhat of how indigenous Australian's describe their relationship with 'country'. So its like she's gradually embracing her own 'indigeneity'... even to the point of adopting or learning the local Yorkshire dialect.
I think this is a great story but I only wish that it could be somehow applied and used somehow to heal some of the terrible wounds inflicted by colonisation in much of the world including Australia. I mean how would you do that? Try and 'translate' the story into an indigenous Australian context? I mean how could you convince people on a wide scale that there is nothing wrong with relating to country in these ways, in fact its probably healthy?
Anyway I also want to know who exactly Frances Hodgson Burnett is and how they came about to writing such an amazing story. Was it inspired by events in their own life? Can you give me a short bio of Frances and a timeline, and where The Secret Garden fits into it.
I want to believe that writing this story was a breeze, a pleasure and a joy for them... but was it? Or did they struggle with anything in particular?
Why don't I really know their name that well? Why am I only now finding out about this story?
Oh and finally, could you tell me a bit about the character of Dickon? He is described by various people in the book as an "angel", an "animal charmer", "fine", "at home in buckingham palace or at the bottom of a coalmine", and trusted with a new born baby. Did Frances know anyone like Dickon in real life? Could someone like that have actually existed? Who has squirrels in his pocket and followed by ravens?

# Response 1
I love how you’re reading it. You’re not just following the plot — you’re noticing the moral weather of the book. I’ll stay well clear of spoilers.

## 1. “Healed by country” — and could a story like this help heal colonial wounds?

What you’re sensing is very real. *The Secret Garden* is, among other things, a story of:

* a child shaped by empire (raised in British India, insulated from “natives”),
* uprooted and brought back to England,
* gradually healed through relationship with land, weather, animals, manual work, and local dialect,
* and softened by belonging.

Burnett never uses the word “indigenous,” of course, but the arc you describe — from imperial detachment to local embeddedness — is there. Mary begins as someone alienated from place and people. The moor teaches her to attend, to breathe differently, to listen.

You’re right that this resonates with how many Indigenous Australians speak about “Country” — not as scenery but as kin, teacher, and source of identity. The book treats land as active, restorative, morally formative.

### But can it “heal” colonial wounds?

That’s complicated.

Stories can:

* shift emotional imagination,
* normalize certain values (like belonging-to-place),
* soften superiority,
* model humility and reciprocity.

They cannot, on their own:

* repair dispossession,
* restore land rights,
* undo structural injustice.

If someone wanted to “apply” this kind of story in Australia, I don’t think translating it into an Indigenous Australian setting would be the most powerful move. That risks appropriation.

More powerful might be:

* encouraging settler-descended Australians to develop a respectful, long-term relationship with the land they’re on,
* elevating Indigenous voices who already articulate profound relationships to Country,
* using stories like *The Secret Garden* to open emotional space for that idea — especially among children.

The book works because it doesn’t preach. It shows change through experience: fresh air, soil under fingernails, companionship, dialect, shared work. If anything, it suggests that alienation from land produces brittleness — and that reconnection produces vitality.

That’s a universal idea. But justice requires more than sentiment.

## 2. Who was Frances Hodgson Burnett?

Short bio, spoiler-free and focused:

**Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849–1924)**

* Born in Manchester, England.
* Her father died when she was young; the family fell into financial hardship.
* At 16, she emigrated with her family to Tennessee, USA.
* Began writing stories as a teenager to support her family financially.
* Became a hugely successful writer on both sides of the Atlantic.

### Timeline

* **1849** – Born in Manchester.
* **1865** – Moves to Tennessee after father’s death and business collapse.
* **1860s–70s** – Publishes short stories in American magazines.
* **1886** – Publishes *Little Lord Fauntleroy* (massive international success).
* **1905** – Publishes *A Little Princess*.
* **1911** – Publishes *The Secret Garden*.
* **1924** – Dies in New York.

*The Secret Garden* was written late in her career — she was in her early 60s when it was published.

## 3. Was it inspired by her own life?

Very much so.

A few important influences:

### 1. Childhood in Industrial England

She was born in Manchester during the Industrial Revolution — smoke, factories, soot. That contrast between gray industrial life and green restorative spaces mattered to her imagination.

### 2. Emigration & displacement

Like Mary, Burnett experienced cultural dislocation — leaving England for America as a teenager after her father died. That sense of loss and transplantation echoes in her work.

### 3. Gardens as therapy

As an adult she developed a deep love of gardening. She created elaborate gardens at her homes in England and the U.S. Gardening wasn’t decorative for her — it was restorative and absorbing. She believed in its psychological benefits.

### 4. Personal grief

Her eldest son, Lionel, died of tuberculosis in 1890 at age 16. This was devastating. After his death, she became deeply interested in ideas of mental vitality, belief, the power of environment, and emotional resilience. You can feel that concern with life-force and renewal in *The Secret Garden* — though I’ll say no more.

So no — it wasn’t written by someone untouched by sorrow. It comes from someone who knew loss and was searching for restoration.

## 4. Was writing it a breeze?

We don’t have diary entries saying “this was pure joy!” — but we do know:

* She was already a seasoned, commercially successful author.
* She had financial pressures for much of her life.
* She endured a difficult marriage and later divorce (uncommon and controversial at the time).
* She experienced deep grief.

By the time she wrote *The Secret Garden*, she had artistic control and experience. It likely wasn’t naive or effortless — but it also wasn’t a desperate beginner’s gamble.

Many scholars think it was more personal and spiritually engaged than some of her earlier, more commercially oriented work.

Interestingly, it wasn’t immediately considered her masterpiece. Its enormous reputation grew later in the 20th century.

## 5. Why don’t you hear her name constantly?

You probably *have* — just not consciously.

She wrote:

* *Little Lord Fauntleroy* (once wildly famous — even influenced children’s fashion),
* *A Little Princess*,
* *The Secret Garden*.

All three are still adapted into films and stage productions.

But:

* Children’s literature often gets culturally sidelined.
* Early 20th-century women writers are frequently less foregrounded in general education.
* Literary prestige has historically favored adult male authors.

Ironically, *The Secret Garden* has grown in stature over time. It’s now widely considered a classic of children’s literature.

You’re not late. You’re arriving at the right moment for you.

## 6. Dickon — could someone like that exist?

Ah, Dickon.

Without spoiling anything: he represents a kind of idealized harmony with the natural world.

Could someone like that exist?

In literal terms:

* A boy with squirrels in his pockets and birds landing on him? That’s romanticized — but not impossible. Rural children historically did tame animals, especially if patient and gentle.
* A person deeply fluent in animal behavior? Absolutely.

In symbolic terms:
Dickon functions almost like:

* a pastoral archetype,
* a green man figure,
* a saint of the moor,
* a pre-industrial innocence.

Did Burnett know someone like him?

There’s no clear record of a single real-life “Dickon,” but:

* She knew rural Yorkshire.
* She spent time observing country people.
* She loved gardens and animals.
* She likely drew from composite impressions of rural youth.

Dickon feels partly realistic, partly mythic — and that’s intentional. He embodies belonging. He is what Mary is moving toward: ease with place.

People like Dickon absolutely exist in some form — people who are:

* steady,
* gentle,
* deeply at home outdoors,
* equally comfortable with animals and humans.

The ravens and squirrels are storytelling exaggerations — but the temperament is real.

## One last thought

What you’re responding to is not just the story — it’s its moral ecology. It suggests:

* alienation is not the natural human state,
* land can restore,
* children can change,
* belonging can be learned.

That’s a powerful message — especially in colonized societies where relationships to land are fractured or contested.

It doesn’t solve history.
But it does propose a different way of inhabiting the world.

And sometimes that’s where healing begins — not in argument, but in imagination.

If you like, when you finish it, we can talk about how your interpretation held up — without ruining anything now.
