# Prompt 1
Imagine someone has just spent a couple of days in Olomouc and they have about 7 more days left. They are quite busy looking after a couple of kids during their school holidays during the day but they say the following:

Olomouc should get an award for the most 'Harry Potter'-style town I've seen so far in Europe. Its really beautiful but I feel like no one really knows about it. Would there be any other towns in europe that could out 'harry potter' it? Or which towns would be the top contenders?
Also given the remaining time left, how can I maximise my learning about the place? Everywhere I look there are mysteries and I wonder how I can make the most of each day or moment. Like obviously there is a lot of history here, but what do I need to know? I feel like I want to know when Olomouc's 'golden age' was? What's the story with the amazing turtle sculpture and fountain? How did the amazing astronomical clock come about and what should I know about that? How should I approach learning what I can of the language? I see some names of streets that might mean something (e.g. 'Kapucin' - its a flower?). I must admit I don't really know anything about CZ let alone how Olomouc fits into that picture. I thought today that I should really learn at least some basic phrases like "sorry" and "excuse me", "thank you", "good day" and "goodbye" etc

Can you give this person some tips and strategies? Also knowning that this person is very interested in the theories of deliberate practice and finding nice 'low intensity, high consistency' tricks for learning all sorts of things. They love finding joy in the activities they do.

What a wonderful situation to be in — stumbling into one of Central Europe's best-kept secrets with curious kids in tow and a week to soak it all up. Let me try to give you something genuinely useful rather than a tourist brochure.

## The Harry Potter Question

You're onto something real. Olomouc has that quality because it's a **living medieval university town** that escaped the 20th century relatively intact — no heavy industrialisation, and crucially, it was considered a "backwater" during communism, which paradoxically *saved* it. The communist regime didn't invest much in tearing it down or modernising it.

If you want towns that could rival or even beat it for that wizarding-world feeling, the top contenders would be:

**Český Krumlov** (also Czech Republic) is probably the single most fairy-tale town in Central Europe — a castle on a river bend, winding cobblestones, and a moat with *actual bears* in it. Absurdly beautiful. It's about 4 hours from Olomouc if you ever want a day trip comparison.

**Görlitz, Germany** is arguably the most filmed town in Europe precisely because it looks so untouched — it's been used as a stand-in for everywhere from 1930s Berlin to fantasy cities. Split across the Polish border (the other half is Zgorzelec), which adds its own magic.

**Tallinn, Estonia** — the medieval old town is extraordinarily preserved, with towers, guild halls, and apothecaries that have been running since the 1400s. It genuinely feels like you could round a corner and find platform 9¾.

**Bruges, Belgium** is the classic answer but feels slightly more like a museum-town now due to tourism. Still stunning.

**Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany** — the most perfectly preserved medieval walled town in Germany. Almost *too* perfect, like a film set.

The reason Olomouc beats most of these is that it's **not performing for tourists**. People actually live and study there. That authenticity is rare and you've landed in it.

## Understanding Where You Are — The Big Picture Fast

Here's the essential mental map, because CZ history is genuinely fascinating once you have the skeleton:

**Bohemia vs. Moravia** — The Czech Republic is essentially two ancient kingdoms. Prague is in Bohemia (west). Olomouc is in **Moravia** (east), and Moravians will quietly but firmly tell you they're different. Moravia was often the more culturally and politically significant half — Olomouc was the capital of Moravia for centuries and was effectively *more important than Prague* for long stretches of history.

**Olomouc's Golden Age** was roughly the **16th and early 17th centuries**, when it was the largest city in Moravia, seat of the bishop, home to the second-oldest university in Central Europe (founded 1573), and a genuine centre of power. The Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) was catastrophic — Swedish forces occupied and plundered the city for eight years, and the population collapsed from roughly 30,000 to about 1,500. The city never fully recovered its former dominance, which is part of why it remained so beautifully frozen.

One other pivotal moment: **Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was crowned King of Bohemia in Olomouc in 1848**, after the revolutions of that year forced the Habsburg court to flee Vienna. Olomouc was literally the refuge of empire. That event matters for why so much Habsburg grandeur ended up here.

## The Astronomical Clock

This is one of the great stories of Cold War cultural vandalism and then reinvention.

The original medieval clock was one of the finest in Europe — comparable to Prague's. During World War II, retreating German forces deliberately **damaged it in May 1945** out of spite. After the war, the communist government restored it but made a very deliberate ideological choice: instead of restoring the medieval saints and kings, they replaced the figures with **workers, scientists, farmers and athletes** — Soviet-style heroes of labour. So the clock you see today is a genuine Cold War artefact, a piece of communist iconography sitting on a medieval Gothic structure. The mosaic style is distinctly Soviet-era.

This makes it arguably *more* interesting than Prague's clock, because it tells you something true about the 20th century, not just the 15th. It still shows astronomical time, the calendar, and phases of the moon — the mechanics are genuinely medieval underneath. The chime happens at noon and is worth being there for.

The key insight for kids: **spot the difference between it and Prague's clock** — one is a monarchist medieval fantasy, the other is a communist one. Same function, totally different ideology on the face.

## The Turtle Fountain

Olomouc has a remarkable collection of **Baroque fountains** — six of them — which is almost unheard of for a town its size. They were built in the late 17th and 18th centuries as the city was rebuilt and embellished after the Swedish devastation. They're essentially the city's way of saying *we're back and we're sophisticated*.

The turtle fountain (the **Caesar Fountain** area or the **Triton Fountain** — look for the one with marine creatures) plays into the Baroque love of combining classical mythology with local civic pride. Turtles and sea creatures in landlocked Moravia were a deliberate display of cosmopolitan knowledge and wealth — *we know about the Mediterranean world, we're not provincial*.

The **Hercules Fountain** and **Jupiter Fountain** are the grandest — these were the Baroque equivalent of public art installations asserting the city's identity. Worth walking slowly between all six and treating them as a trail. There's actually a mapped fountain trail you can pick up.

## Learning Czech — The Deliberate Practice Approach

This is where it gets fun, because Czech is genuinely hard but **Olomouc is a perfect classroom** for exactly the low-intensity high-consistency approach you love.

**The street name trick you've already discovered is gold.** You're right that street names are a dictionary waiting to be read. A few to get you started:

*Kapucín* doesn't actually mean the flower (that's *kapucínka* in the botanical sense) — it refers to **Capuchin friars**, the monastic order. You'll likely find a Capuchin church or monastery nearby. This is extremely common in Central European towns — street names are a map of what *used to be there*.

Some other patterns to look for: *Horní/Dolní* = upper/lower. *Nová/Stará* = new/old. *Kostelní* = relating to a church (*kostel*). *Vodní* = water. *Zahradní* = garden. *Královská* = royal. Once you have ten of these, you can read the logic of a medieval town just by walking through it.

**The essential phrases** — here they are with a rough pronunciation guide:

| Phrase | Czech | Say it like |
|---|---|---|
| Good day (formal hello) | Dobrý den | DOH-bree den |
| Good morning | Dobré ráno | DOH-breh RAH-no |
| Goodbye | Na shledanou | Nah SKLE-dah-no |
| Please / You're welcome | Prosím | PROH-seem |
| Thank you | Děkuji | DYEH-koo-yi |
| Thank you (informal) | Díky | DEE-ky |
| Sorry / Excuse me | Promiňte | PROH-min-te |
| Excuse me (passing through) | S dovolením | S doh-voh-LEH-neem |
| Yes / No | Ano / Ne | AH-no / Neh |

A lovely low-intensity trick: **learn one new word per landmark**. Every fountain, church, or square has a name. Look it up. The word *náměstí* (square) will become automatic within a day because you'll see it everywhere. *Chrám* (cathedral), *věž* (tower), *hrad* (castle/fort) — these start clicking fast because the environment reinforces them constantly.

**For the kids**, turn it into a daily game: whoever uses a Czech word correctly with a local gets a point. Czech people are genuinely delighted when visitors try, and you'll get warm responses that make the kids feel great about it.

## Maximising the Remaining 7 Days — The Low-Intensity High-Consistency Framework

Given that you're with kids during the day and can't do deep-dive museum hours, think in **micro-layers** rather than scheduled learning blocks.

**Morning anchor habit**: Before leaving wherever you're staying each morning, spend five minutes with a single question: *what's one thing I want to understand better today?* Not a list — just one. It could be "why are there so many churches?" or "what happened here during WWII?" That question then acts as a lens for everything you see.

**The 'explain it to the kids' trick**: This is a genuine deliberate practice method — the Feynman technique in disguise. When you encounter something interesting, try explaining it to your kids at their level. You'll immediately discover what you don't actually understand yet, which focuses your next learning moment.

**Podcast/audio while they sleep or you walk**: Search for anything on Habsburg history, or specifically Moravian history. Even a general Central European history podcast listened to in 20-minute chunks before bed will make everything you see the next day more meaningful. You're essentially building a frame that the daytime experiences slot into.

**The fountain trail as a daily rhythm**: Walk the six fountains in sequence as an evening stroll — it's completely free, takes about 40 minutes at a gentle pace, and each time you'll notice something different. This kind of repeated exposure to the same things is underrated for actually *absorbing* a place.

**One question for every meal**: Czech food culture is worth understanding too — ask at a restaurant what a dish *is* before ordering it. *Co je to?* (What is this?) is a complete sentence and an icebreaker.

The deeper truth about a place like Olomouc is that it rewards **slowness** more than most cities. The Harry Potter feeling you had? That comes from stumbling, from turning corners without a plan, from noticing a worn coat of arms above a doorway and wondering whose it was. You can't schedule that — but you can make yourself available to it by not over-programming the days.

You've found something genuinely special. The best thing you can do with the next seven days is let it be strange and let it ask you questions.
