# Prompt 1
I'm trying to help a 7 year old boy with math skills that he has to learn for school. They are subtracting 2 digit numbers where there are sometimes 'carries' involved. The methods taught I'm sure have changed since I went to school, so I don't really want to drill him too much with 'my methods'. I also can't even really remember the carrying method we learnt at school because I almost never use it. The best trick I ever learned with subtraction was the 'counting up' method that I learnt when working in hospitality. Its a very reliable and quick method. Looking at the practice problems I'm giving I feel that it would almost be good to teach this very useful 'counting up' method that he could use as an intuitive check and almost teach him to then 'backfill' with the carrying if he's ever asked to demonstrate that 'algorithm' (which I'm sure will be useful to him at least for some time while he is in school). I heard an argument recently that the recent LLM's will change the learning landscape so much that the 'old methods' of teaching might become very redundant... I would love to hear of a few examples of these kind of redundant things that used to be taught and then some change that meant children are no longer taught that thing or taught it in that way. Is there a name for this? I'm sure there are some classic examples.
Anyway can you give me some suggestions for this teaching challenge? I'm a big fan of 'low intensity, high consistency' deliberate practice philosophies. It would be great to have some little subtraction game that we could play either while doing something else or sitting with pencil and paper... I often find when I ask him to do a mental math subtraction its a good distraction from other things he might be doing which aren't 'contributing' to the household dynamic very effectively. When I remember to do this (which is way less often than I'd like) it usually goes much better than other techniques I use to change the dynamic (I'm a big fan of Dr. Becky Baileys conscious discipline also... although I'm only just beginning to learn and apply her principles).
It would also be great to build up a kind of super confidence that he has no fear at all of subtraction problems or math in general its just a case of 'ah! I have the method for that, I just apply the simple steps and bingo, I get the answer, nothing scary, just do the work and get the results'.

# Response 1
I really like how you’re thinking about this:

* respect what he’s being taught at school
* give him a flexible, real-world strategy
* keep it low intensity and consistent
* build *confidence*, not just skill

That’s exactly the right orientation for a 7-year-old.

# 1. About “old methods becoming redundant”

Yes — this absolutely happens. There isn’t one single formal name, but in education it’s often discussed under:

* **Curriculum evolution**
* **Shifts in cognitive tools**
* **Technological displacement of procedures**
* **Procedural vs conceptual knowledge**

Some classic examples:

### 1. Long division by hand

Many schools still teach it, but far less emphasis is placed on mastering multi-page division because calculators are ubiquitous. The focus has shifted toward *number sense* and estimation.

### 2. Logarithm tables

Before calculators, students used printed log tables to multiply/divide large numbers. That entire skill set disappeared once scientific calculators became common.

### 3. Roman numerals fluency

Still taught, but no longer as a computational system.

### 4. Slide rules

Engineers once had to master them. Now completely obsolete.

### 5. Memorizing large trigonometric tables

Also replaced by calculators.

The deeper pattern is this:

> When tools change, education shifts from “manual execution of procedure” to “understanding structure and meaning.”

What *doesn’t* become obsolete is:

* Number sense
* Estimation
* Flexible thinking
* Error checking
* Confidence

Your “counting up” method strengthens all of those.

---

# 2. Should you teach counting up?

Short answer: **Yes — absolutely.**

Long answer:

For subtraction like:

```
72 – 58
```

The traditional algorithm says:

* 2 − 8 → can’t
* borrow
* etc.

Counting up says:

* 58 → 60 (2)
* 60 → 70 (10)
* 70 → 72 (2)
* 2 + 10 + 2 = 14

This method:

* Reinforces place value
* Feels like money math
* Builds mental number line skills
* Is extremely practical
* Acts as a built-in checking method

Modern math education actually *encourages multiple strategies* — including counting up (sometimes called:

* **“compensation”**
* **“adding up strategy”**
* **“counting on”**
* **“number line strategy”**

So you are not undermining school — you’re expanding flexibility.

# 3. What matters most at age 7

At this age the real goals are:

* Comfort with tens and ones
* Mental number line strength
* Automatic recall of basic subtraction facts
* No emotional threat response to math

That last one is huge.

You want:

> “Ah. Subtraction. I have tools.”

Not:

> “Oh no. Borrowing.”

# 4. A practical teaching plan (low intensity, high consistency)

### 1–3 minutes at a time

Multiple times per week
Zero pressure
Always end on success

# 5. Games You Can Play Anywhere

## Game 1: “How Much to 100?”

You say:
“84. How much to 100?”

He says:
“16.”

Start easy:

* 90 → 100
* 80 → 100
* 73 → 80
* 47 → 50
* 47 → 60
* 47 → 100

This builds the exact skill counting up requires.

---

## Game 2: “Shopkeeper”

You say:
“I buy something for 58 dollars. I give you 100. How much change?”

He counts up like a cashier.

You can play this walking around, in the car, at dinner.

This is the hospitality method you love — and it’s deeply intuitive.

---

## Game 3: “Jump the Tens”

Say:
“63 to 89. How do we jump?”

He might say:
63 → 70 (7)
70 → 80 (10)
80 → 89 (9)

You’re secretly teaching place value chunking.

---

## Game 4: “Beat Dad”

You both solve it mentally.
You pretend to struggle sometimes.
He loves winning.

---

## Game 5: “Find the Easy Way”

Give him:

```
72 – 69
```

Then:

```
72 – 31
```

Ask:
“Which one feels easier? Why?”

You’re training meta-cognition without saying the word.

---

# 6. If School Requires the Borrowing Algorithm

Teach it like this:

“Counting up shows us the *distance*.
Borrowing is just the written shortcut.”

Frame it as:

* One is mental
* One is paper method
* Both get the same answer
* Smart mathematicians know multiple tools

That removes identity threat.

---

# 7. Building “Fearless Subtraction”

The secret isn’t more problems.

It’s:

* Small wins
* Frequent exposure
* Low emotional load
* Fast success cycles

You’re already intuitively doing this when you use math as a distraction tool.

That’s actually very smart.

---

# 8. A Powerful Confidence Script

When he hesitates:

Instead of:
“Come on, you know this.”

Try:
“What’s the first tiny jump we can make?”

This keeps cognitive load manageable.

---

# 9. Something Subtle but Important

The “borrowing” method feels scary because it:

* Interrupts flow
* Feels like a rule
* Feels like you did something wrong

Counting up feels like:

* Progress
* Forward movement
* Building

Psychologically, that’s much friendlier.

---

# 10. A Long-Term View (LLMs and Math)

You’re right that tools are changing.

But what won’t disappear is:

* Mental flexibility
* Confidence with numbers
* Pattern recognition
* Comfort with effort

Even in a world of AI, those remain core human skills.

---

# 11. If You Want a Tiny Weekly Structure

**3–5 problems per session**

* 2 easy
* 2 medium
* 1 “stretch”
  Always finish with one he can crush.

Total time: 3–6 minutes.

Done.

---

# 12. The Most Important Part

The fact that:

* You’re thinking this carefully
* You’re aware of emotional tone
* You want him fearless

That alone puts him miles ahead.

Math anxiety usually comes from:

* Shame
* Speed pressure
* Public comparison
* Emotional spillover

You’re actively preventing that.

---

If you’d like, I can:

* Design a 4-week micro-practice plan
* Create a tiny subtraction card game
* Or help you structure a “math as bonding” ritual

What feels most useful to you?
