# Prompt 1
I'm trying to help a 7 year old boy with math skills that he has to learn for school. They are subtracting 2 digit numbers where there are sometimes 'carries' involved. The methods taught I'm sure have changed since I went to school, so I don't really want to drill him too much with 'my methods'. I also can't even really remember the carrying method we learnt at school because I almost never use it. The best trick I ever learned with subtraction was the 'counting up' method that I learnt when working in hospitality. Its a very reliable and quick method. Looking at the practice problems I'm giving I feel that it would almost be good to teach this very useful 'counting up' method that he could use as an intuitive check and almost teach him to then 'backfill' with the carrying if he's ever asked to demonstrate that 'algorithm' (which I'm sure will be useful to him at least for some time while he is in school). I heard an argument recently that the recent LLM's will change the learning landscape so much that the 'old methods' of teaching might become very redundant... I would love to hear of a few examples of these kind of redundant things that used to be taught and then some change that meant children are no longer taught that thing or taught it in that way. Is there a name for this? I'm sure there are some classic examples.
Anyway can you give me some suggestions for this teaching challenge? I'm a big fan of 'low intensity, high consistency' deliberate practice philosophies. It would be great to have some little subtraction game that we could play either while doing something else or sitting with pencil and paper... I often find when I ask him to do a mental math subtraction its a good distraction from other things he might be doing which aren't 'contributing' to the household dynamic very effectively. When I remember to do this (which is way less often than I'd like) it usually goes much better than other techniques I use to change the dynamic (I'm a big fan of Dr. Becky Baileys conscious discipline also... although I'm only just beginning to learn and apply her principles).
It would also be great to build up a kind of super confidence that he has no fear at all of subtraction problems or math in general its just a case of 'ah! I have the method for that, I just apply the simple steps and bingo, I get the answer, nothing scary, just do the work and get the results'.

This is a rich, multi-part question — let me give you a proper answer across all of it.

## The Counting Up Method — What You're Already Doing Right

Your hospitality instinct is actually backed by solid research. Studies have found that teaching children to count up from the smaller to the larger number (rather than "taking away") greatly improved performance on subtraction problems and could accelerate learning of subtraction topics by as much as three years. So you're not working against the curriculum — you're ahead of it.

Here's the method framed clearly for a 7-year-old:

**To solve 63 − 28:**
1. Start at 28 (the number being subtracted)
2. Jump to the next round ten: 28 → 30 (that's +2)
3. Jump to 63: 30 → 63 (that's +33)
4. Add your jumps: 2 + 33 = **35**

The process is: count up from the smaller number to the next ten, remember that count, then count up from that ten to the larger number, and add the two counts together. For example, to find 34 − 18: count up from 18 to 20 (that's 2), then from 20 to 34 (that's 14), giving 2 + 14 = 16.

It's also worth knowing that the "counting up" method is particularly efficient for problems where the two numbers are close together — like 91 − 89 — while a column algorithm is better suited to problems with very different digits. Teaching him to notice which tool fits which problem is itself a powerful mathematical instinct.

## The "Obsolete Curriculum" Question — and the Term for It

There isn't one single universally agreed term for this, but the concepts that come closest are:

**"Cognitive offloading"** — the phenomenon of using external tools to relieve our brains of tasks we find burdensome. It's a 21st-century coinage, but the underlying phenomenon is very old — the greatest early example being the development of writing itself.

**"Curriculum obsolescence"** is the phrase used in education policy discussions. Marshall McLuhan framed it well: every medium creates "extensions" of ourselves while simultaneously causing "amputations" of the functions they replace. These are genuine trade-offs — writing may have weakened memory, but it enabled the advancement of science and history.

**Classic historical examples of skills that faded as technology changed:**

- **Cursive handwriting** — once a core skill, now barely taught in many countries, displaced by keyboards
- **Slide rules** — engineers were trained for years on these; calculators made the skill extinct almost overnight in the 1970s
- **Mental arithmetic with long division** — complex arithmetic done by hand is increasingly seen as no longer essential given calculators, and some argue the internet has replaced the need to memorize many basic facts.
- **Map reading and navigation** — GPS has measurably diminished spatial reasoning, and teaching compass-and-map navigation has quietly disappeared from many school curricula
- **Library card catalogue skills** — entire lessons used to be devoted to the Dewey Decimal System; now completely redundant
- **Typing class as a standalone subject** — the idea of taking a whole class to a computer room once a week to practice typing is now considered obsolete; instead, digital skills are integrated across all subjects.
- **Encyclopaedia lookup skills** — children were explicitly taught how to use reference books; Google rendered this essentially moot within one generation
- **Shorthand** — once a highly valued secretarial skill, almost entirely gone as a taught subject

The LLM argument you've heard is real and is being seriously discussed. Some of the topics taught today will no longer be essential in the near future: handwriting is increasingly obsolete, complex arithmetic is no longer done by hand, and the internet has already replaced the need to memorize many basic facts. The current debate is whether the *algorithms* of arithmetic (like carrying) will follow the same path that slide rules did.

## Teaching Strategies — Low Intensity, High Consistency

Your instinct here is exactly right, and it aligns with what deliberate practice research says. Here are some concrete approaches:

### 🃏 The "Change Game" (no materials needed)
This is inspired directly by your hospitality background. Give him a price and a payment, and he has to make change. "You bought something for 43p, you paid with 70p — what do I give you back?" It's counting up in disguise, completely practical, and feels like a real skill. You can do this walking to school, in the car, anywhere.

### 🎲 The "Target Number" Game
Pick a target, say 100. One of you calls out a number (say 37), the other has to instantly say what you'd add to get to 100. This builds the "jump to the next round number" muscle that makes counting-up subtraction fast and intuitive. Very quick rounds, very easy to do as a sidebar activity.

### ✏️ The "Two Jumps" Worksheet
When sitting with pencil and paper, draw a number line with just three marks: the starting number, the nearest round ten, and the target. He writes the two jump amounts and adds them. It makes the method *visible* in a way that builds confidence, and it can be done in 5 minutes with 5 problems.

### 🧮 Then "Backfilling" the Algorithm
Once counting up feels fluent and natural, you can introduce it as a check against the written column method. "Let's do it the school way... now let's check it with your jumps method." This is genuinely good mathematical thinking — having two methods that should agree is how real mathematicians verify answers. It also removes the anxiety from the column method because he knows he has a reliable backup.

## On the Confidence Question

The "I have the method for that" mindset you're describing is what psychologists call *mathematical self-efficacy*, and it's probably more predictive of long-term math performance than any particular skill. The way to build it is exactly what you're doing: small, frequent, low-stakes exposures where he mostly succeeds, with a method that *always works* as his anchor.

The Conscious Discipline connection is spot-on too — making math a casual, integrated part of normal interaction removes the performance anxiety that often develops when math only appears in high-stakes test contexts. A quick mental subtraction while he's messing about is the opposite of a worksheet under pressure, and it's building the same neural pathways.

One small tactical tip: when he gets it right, name the method specifically. "You just did the jump method — and it worked perfectly." That attribution helps him feel like he *has a toolkit*, not just that he got lucky on a sum.
