# Prompt 1
I'm trying to help a 7 year old boy with math skills that he has to learn for school. They are subtracting 2 digit numbers where there are sometimes 'carries' involved. The methods taught I'm sure have changed since I went to school, so I don't really want to drill him too much with 'my methods'. I also can't even really remember the carrying method we learnt at school because I almost never use it. The best trick I ever learned with subtraction was the 'counting up' method that I learnt when working in hospitality. Its a very reliable and quick method. Looking at the practice problems I'm giving I feel that it would almost be good to teach this very useful 'counting up' method that he could use as an intuitive check and almost teach him to then 'backfill' with the carrying if he's ever asked to demonstrate that 'algorithm' (which I'm sure will be useful to him at least for some time while he is in school). I heard an argument recently that the recent LLM's will change the learning landscape so much that the 'old methods' of teaching might become very redundant... I would love to hear of a few examples of these kind of redundant things that used to be taught and then some change that meant children are no longer taught that thing or taught it in that way. Is there a name for this? I'm sure there are some classic examples.
Anyway can you give me some suggestions for this teaching challenge? I'm a big fan of 'low intensity, high consistency' deliberate practice philosophies. It would be great to have some little subtraction game that we could play either while doing something else or sitting with pencil and paper... I often find when I ask him to do a mental math subtraction its a good distraction from other things he might be doing which aren't 'contributing' to the household dynamic very effectively. When I remember to do this (which is way less often than I'd like) it usually goes much better than other techniques I use to change the dynamic (I'm a big fan of Dr. Becky Baileys conscious discipline also... although I'm only just beginning to learn and apply her principles).
It would also be great to build up a kind of super confidence that he has no fear at all of subtraction problems or math in general its just a case of 'ah! I have the method for that, I just apply the simple steps and bingo, I get the answer, nothing scary, just do the work and get the results'.

# Response 1
This is a fantastic approach. You are essentially describing a transition from "rote memorization" to "number sense," which is actually exactly where modern math education is trying to go (even if the worksheets sometimes look confusing).

Your intuition to use the **"Counting Up"** method (often called the **"Shopkeeper’s Method"** or **"Complementary Addition"**) is spot on. In fact, many modern curricula (like Singapore Math or Common Core) rely heavily on "Number Lines," which is the visual representation of exactly what you are doing in your head.

Here is a breakdown of how to handle the teaching aspect, the "redundancy" philosophical question you asked, and some specific "low intensity" games that fit your parenting style.

### Part 1: The "Backfilling" Strategy vs. The Number Line
You mentioned teaching him to "backfill" the school method. While I understand the temptation, there is a risk: if he fakes the "borrowing" marks without understanding *why* he is doing them, he will hit a wall when numbers get to 3 or 4 digits.

**The Solution:** Connect your "Counting Up" method to the school's **"Number Line"** method.

1.  **The School Method (Regrouping/Borrowing):** This is based on place value. You can't take 8 ones from 2 ones, so you break a 10 into ones.
2.  **Your Method (Counting Up):** This is based on the *distance* between numbers.

**How to teach it:**
Tell him: *"Subtraction is just measuring the distance between two numbers. Like measuring how far it is from your house to the park."*
*   **Problem:** $52 - 38$
*   **Your Method:** Start at 38. Jump 2 to get to 40. Jump 12 to get to 52. Answer: $2 + 12 = 14$.
*   **The "School" Check:** Have him do the "Counting Up" first to get the answer ($14$). Then, have him do the vertical subtraction. When he gets stuck on $2 - 8$, tell him, "We need more ones. Let's steal a ten." When he finishes, say, "Did we get 14? Yes? Then we know the math is right."

**Confidence Hack:** By finding the answer *his* way first, he creates a safety net. The vertical subtraction becomes a "confirmation ritual" rather than a scary guess.

### Part 2: Educational Obsolescence (The "Redundant" Skills)
You asked about things that used to be taught that are now obsolete due to technology. There isn't one catchy single word for this, but in educational theory, this falls under **"Curriculum Obsolescence"** or the shift from **"Procedural Fluency" to "Conceptual Understanding."**

The argument regarding LLMs is that we are moving from a world where humans need to *generate* answers to a world where humans need to *verify* answers.

**Examples of "Redundant" Teaching:**

1.  **The Slide Rule & Logarithm Tables:**
    *   **Then:** Before the 1970s, high schoolers spent semesters learning how to look up values in massive books of tables to do complex multiplication.
    *   **Now:** The pocket calculator (and now the phone) killed this instantly. We now teach *estimation* so you know if the calculator's answer looks right.
2.  **Strict Cursive Penmanship:**
    *   **Then:** Essential for business speed before typewriters/computers.
    *   **Now:** Many schools dropped it entirely (though some are bringing it back for fine motor skills). Typing speed is the new functional literacy.
3.  **The Square Root Algorithm:**
    *   **Then:** There is a long division-style algorithm to calculate square roots by hand. It was standard until the 80s.
    *   **Now:** Almost no one knows it exists. You estimate it ($ \sqrt{50} $ is a little more than 7) or press a button.
4.  **Spelling as a Gatekeeper:**
    *   **Then:** If you couldn't spell, you couldn't be a writer or professional.
    *   **Now:** With autocorrect and LLMs, *vocabulary* (knowing which word to use) is more important than letter-perfect spelling.

**The Takeaway for your son:** The "Vertical Subtraction Algorithm" is currently in a "zombie" state. It’s not quite dead (because writing it out helps understand place value), but as an adult skill, it is largely replaced by mental math (Counting Up) or calculators.

### Part 3: Low Intensity, High Consistency Games
Since you like Dr. Becky Bailey, you know that the brain learns best in a state of "relaxed alertness." Here are three games.

#### 1. The "Make the Next Ten" Game (Mental / Car ride)
This is the prerequisite for your "Counting Up" method. He needs to instantly know what gets him to the nearest 10.
*   **You:** "I'm at 38, get me to the next station (40)."
*   **Him:** "2!"
*   **You:** "I'm at 54."
*   **Him:** "6!"
*   *Why:* This removes the cognitive load. Once he automates this, $52 - 38$ becomes easy because the first step (38 to 40) is automatic.

#### 2. "Subtraction War" (Card Game)
Use a deck of cards (remove face cards, or make Face Cards = 10).
*   Deal two cards to you, two to him.
*   You both make a 2-digit number (e.g., a 4 and a 7 becomes 47 or 74).
*   **The Twist:** To win the cards, you don't just need the higher number; you have to say the **difference** between your number and his number.
*   *Use the method:* "Okay, I have 82, you have 50. Count up from 50 to 82."

#### 3. "The Waiter Check" (Roleplay)
This fits your hospitality background.
*   Get a receipt pad. Write a random price (e.g., $24).
*   Hand him a fake $50 bill (or write "Paid with $50").
*   He has to calculate the change by counting up.
*   $24 \rightarrow 25$ ($1$) $\rightarrow$ $30$ ($5$) $\rightarrow$ $50$ ($20$). Total change: $26$.
*   *Dr. Bailey Connection:* This is a "helping" job. It builds significance and contribution.

### Part 4: The Conscious Discipline Approach
You mentioned using math to "change the dynamic." This is actually scientifically sound!

When a child is whining or acting out (emotional/limbic brain), their **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**—the logical part—is offline. Doing a math problem *forces* the PFC to turn on. It’s a "brain state shift."

**How to frame it for "Super Confidence":**

1.  **The "Oops" Ritual:**
    If he gets it wrong, don't correct him immediately.
    *   **You:** "Hmm, my brain got a different number. I got 14. How did you get 12? Walk me through it."
    *   **Goal:** He learns that a wrong answer isn't a failure; it's a puzzle to investigate.

2.  **The Narrative:**
    "Math isn't about being smart. It's about having a recipe. If you follow the recipe, you get the cake. The 'Counting Up' trick is our secret family recipe."

3.  **The "Distraction":**
    If he is bouncing off the walls:
    *   **You:** (Playful, confused tone) "Wait, hang on. I need help. I have 73 legos here and I need to take away 19 to fit them in the box. How many are left? I can't figure it out."
    *   This moves him from **"I am bored/annoying"** to **"I am a helper/solver."**

By teaching him "Counting Up" as his primary tool and the school method as his "formal proof," you give him the speed of a hospitality worker and the grade-checking of a student.
