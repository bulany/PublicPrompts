# Prompt 1
# Artists Have No Moat
There was a famous leaked email from google "we have no moat" when OpenAI "made google dance" by having release ChatGPT ahead of any of their AI products.
I think its the case now that its not only Google that has no moat (although I think they have rebuilt theirs a bit) but its all "knowledge workers" in general that have "no moat".
I think its interesting to first consider a few example of "moats" that were existing for artists and other people. 
Did the Beatles have a moat?
I think of the black and white footage I've seen of young Beatles fans going really wild for them... 1000s of people just crazy about 4 guys... its a real exclusivity dynamic. And I want to believe as some people say "talent doesn't exist"... these were just 4 average guys, in the right place at the right time doing the right amount of work. I say in the right place at the right time meaning that access to recording studios was pretty limited. Its not like today where anyone can make a really high quality recording in their own home, maybe even with just a readily available smart phone... (this sounds similar to the Apollo spacecraft analogy - we have more computing power available in our pockets than was needed to successfully land on the moon... so that was one of the aspects of the 'space travel moat' that has been bridged, I think the space travel moat is still very intact though as it takes a lot of resources to leave earth orbit (right?)). 
So you had these four average young guys who somehow got access to the recording studios and were then able to mass produce 7 inch singles or whatever product it was to a huge audience... you had this new "consumption dynamic" that was put in place. Now the music industry is a completely transformed landscape due to things like readily available recording equipment and the internet for distribution to a potentially even larger audience... and most of the time its not behind a 'pay wall' or physical record shop counter where there has to be money exchanged as part of the distribution.
Sometimes I think a good analogy of the current LLM revolution is that there were a lot of people who were working like the monks who hand copied bibles... working away all day in their "cells"... and then gutenberg and the printing press came along, and suddenly you didn't need all those monks any more. Do you think that's kind of accurate? What do you call it? LLMs? Machine Learning? AI? Whatever you call it, its like a new form of printing press or a new media like photography or cinema was which completely distorts the pre-existing landscapes.
And we may think that our jobs are safe, but have a look at what happened to the photo shops and chemists where you used to be able to get your camera film developed... I think the real picture is that there are a lot of us working in film processing labs without necessarily realising it. 
But ok, its not all bad right? Like I didn't see protests and a massive economic impact after the photo labs closed... or was there? What did all these people do?
I also saw another documentary about the last manual typesetters working at the New York Times newspaper. Changes in technology meant they retrained and got other jobs... or did they? Was that all bad news?
I mean is there that one man creator of WordPress? He's like a bit of a gutenberg guy right? Because he opened up self publishing to a previously unimagined set of people? Much less need for a traditional press right?

Now this is being really honest but I've always had a little beef with John Lennon. His song 'imagine'... its a fantastic song... I mean its really great (what are some of the concrete reasons is it so great?)... but I have often thought... its trying to get you to imagine this really utopian world and yet if I were to go out into the street and busk with this song to make enough money to eat dinner I could potentially be fined or called a criminal, right? I don't believe there's a line in the song that says "imagine there's no intellectual property" or "imagine there's no private property", but aren't these two of the things that would be really holding back Lennon's imagined utopia. And he seems to have the nerve to sing all of that from the comfort of a mansion (I heard a story he asked his gardener to only grow white roses or something, and he laid in bed all day or something)... I would love to lay in bed all day but unfortunately I would soon starve. It seems to be me part of the reason he was able to lay in bed was because he was recieving royalties from songs like imagine... lots and lots of royalities. Can you see the hypocracy in that or am I missing something? Has someone else made this point much better than me?

Anyway, John Lennon also had a moat. His intellectual property moat (or all those laws that hold that system up... laws that are fundamentally back by violence - right?). 

Another moat is the Avatar thing... before you needed to be James Cameron with millions of dollars to produce a movie on the level of Avatar. But I think possibly within a few years this will be vastly more accessible and anyone who can type out a story prompt in enough detail and can afford to pay the inference for the video model could produce a film of similar quality.

So the artists lose their traditional moat but the upside is that 'everyday people' have more creative opportunities. Can we imagine a world without the moats or with way less of them. Can we imagine a *great* world without the moats? What would this look like?

I would love to turn these ideas into a punchy short article... something with a tweetable headline that speaks directly to that google-no-moat idea... in the way that people sometimes say variations on 'watergate' to get the message across that we are dealing with a similar thing (could you give me a few of those examples)? 
I would like the article/piece to be in the style of an article I'm attaching below... like I guess similar length and similar story telling style. Do you think you could give an analysis of that article's style and story telling style... like how would you describe the way it works on the reader and whether you think its good or not.

I would also like you to consider the article written by Matt Shumer here: https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening I don't know if the Covid analogy is the best here because I feel that things have kind of gone back to a reasonable normal since... I wonder if the invention of the cinema in Lyon would be a better analogy. I thought I heard a story that people ran out of the first cinemas in fear that a train was going to run over them. And now life has pretty much gone back to normal... the cinema is part of our everyday lives.

Anyway I would appreciate your thoughts on all this. Thanks!

# An ode to the Brodburger

Driving past late on cold Canberra nights I’d seen those caravan fairy lights. In their faint glow between the trees they half-illuminated a mystery. What could possibly be keep all those people standing out there in the freezing cold by this forgotten corner of Lake Burley Griffin?

I reasoned it must be some illegal gambling setup or a bizarre old-timers night-sailing club. Driving past another night with a friend I got more of the story: “Apparently, he’s a world famous chef, but now he only does burgers. Does ’em with blue cheese and brie and stuff – they’re meant to be really good. That’s what keeps the people standing out there.”

Curious to find out more, last Friday night I finally got my chance. Accessing the place is a challenge in itself – you have to approach from the right direction, but beware: once you find that turn-off, your life may change forever. I parked the car amongst the healthy crowd of others, still shaking my head as to how this place, miles from any movie theatres, shops or heating could draw a crowd at this hour. Getting out and edging my way into the huddle standing around the caravan I could tell I was impinging on a new culture with already established customs.

“Are you guys in line?” I gingerly asked the motley assembly of mostly blokes who looked as if they’d done this all before

“Line? Nah mate, there’s none of that… you’ve just gotta use the force or something. You’ll get the hang of it.”

There was something bizarre about this power dynamic. A group of half freezing guys staring into a cosy looking gypsy cabin, waiting on salvation.

I squinted to make out the menu. “Listen,” a beanied regular advised me, “if it’s your first time you’ll probably want to start with a blue cheese Brodburger, then you can work you way through the other options from there”.

Obviously he thought I’d be back to brave the cold again. “Look mate, it’s not uncommon for first-timers to score a Brodtrick off the bat”. “A Brod-trick?” I stammered. “Yeah”, he chuckled to his mate, “three nights in a row!”

It’s not only blokes who seem to be mad about these burgers. Another shiverer confided: “Every time I drive past here with my wife, she laments that we’ve just eaten, or that it’s not dinner-time. Now I have to bring the burgers back to her while she waits where it’s warm”.

The place was certainly getting a good rap from customers. Surveying the crowd of a dozen or so, you could see that underneath their veneer of blokey stoicness, these guys seemed almost proud of something. Jumping out of the caravan to grab more bread rolls out of his car, I took my chance to encounter the man behind operation that so fascinated me.

“I guess you must be Brod”, I tried unconvincingly.

His warm response seemed to wash away any nervousness I had. “Yeah, I am. Sasha actually. Sasha Brodbeck”.

Sporting only a black T-shirt against the cold, his relaxed and friendly manner seemed to draw me further into the enchantment of the place. I had time to learn that he’d had the place open just 4 months before he quickly jumped back behind the grill to keep up with the run of orders.

It was then however that the magic of that gypsy caravan really kicked into overdrive. “Right, is anyone waiting to order?” called the girl from inside, flicking a curl of black hair out of her equally dark eyes. It was my turn.

Her manner, her smile, the way she threw off the cajoling of the onlooking guys… everything was perfect. I wanted to film the Australian version of American Graffiti right there and then. There were no cash registers, no eftpos or state of the art ordering systems, or slick café fit-outs. It’s was just good old fashioned “show me the money and I’ll show you the burger”.

I briefly wondered if it was all a carefully engineered marketing scheme – did she hand me the free chips just to be nice, or could she tell I was fresh meat, the only customer she hadn’t seen before. Maybe there is a dark secret.

I can just imagine a black t-shirt clad Sasha making his pact with the devil, securing his place in the hearts of Canberran’s over the souls of a few hapless bovine beasts. Or maybe it’s just that there is some kind of gypsy caravan magic powering those fairy lights. In any case, it didn’t matter now, I was firmly under the Brodburger spell.

Enchanted.

My number is called and she hands over my burgers. I seem to be the last customer around, but someone who’s just a bit too far from the fairylight glow pipes up that he’s still waiting.

A contented but shivering burger-eater jokes “If you think they’re too slow, McDonalds is just down the road!” Everyone laughs, but behind the joke seems to lurk a threat: “Just you go and try it, punk”.

Somehow the fairylights and the fabled burgers have formed a faithful brotherhood. Going anywhere else is the last thing anyone has on their mind. It’s as if the wait in the cold is a test of the burger-eater’s mettle.

Sasha takes advantage of the lull in business to get out from behind the grill and light a cigarette. It’s 8pm and the night still feels young, although quite bitterly cold. As I walk away, burger in hand, I think it might be a lonely stretch for him from here till the end of the night. But before the thought has time to finish, a gang of six sports bikes roars in. Parking right up near the caravan, they are cursing and joking as they take off their helmets.

Where they have been sounds exciting – I’m almost tempted to lurk in the caravan light to glean some details of their exploits. Sasha stamps his cigarette out and jumps back behind the grill. Obviously they knew about this spot. Maybe they fell under caravan’s spell just like me.

Whether he has engineered it or not – Sasha Brodburg has created a real place. A place that will put Canberra on the map much more than the latest architectural masterpiece or grand monument. He, along with Bibimbap’s at Korean student joints and friendly staff at the Dendy cinemas are slowly giving Canberra what it’s been lacking for so long: the special sauce that Burley Griffin, no matter how meticulous he was, couldn’t fit into his plan.

Regardless of how good the burgers are (and you’ll have to judge them for yourselves), Brodburg should already be unanimously celebrated for that.

Driving away with my hard-won burger by my side, my thoughts run-riot about what summer may hold for Sasha and his caravan.

For him and for Canberra, I hope the gypsy magic of those fairy lights lasts a little longer.

August 2009



# Response 1
You’re circling a big cluster of ideas here: moats, technology shocks, intellectual property, hypocrisy, democratization, the printing press, AI, Lennon, Cameron, WordPress. Let me try to give this some structure without sanding off the sharp edges.

---

## 1. Did The Beatles have a moat?

Yes — but it wasn’t just “talent.”

Their moat had at least four layers:

**1. Access moat (production).**
In the early 1960s, recording at Abbey Road wasn’t something four random guys could just do. Studio time, tape, engineers — scarce and expensive. Gatekeepers decided who got in.

**2. Distribution moat.**
Vinyl pressing plants, radio, television appearances. You couldn’t upload to Spotify. If you got onto the BBC or Ed Sullivan, you had a national pipe into millions of living rooms.

**3. Cultural coordination moat.**
Mass media was centralized. Everyone watched the same shows. So when Beatlemania hit, it hit all at once. Scarcity + synchronization = hysteria.

**4. IP moat.**
Once the songs existed, copyright locked in royalties. That moat compounds.

Were they “average guys in the right place at the right time”?
Right place/time absolutely mattered. But lots of people were in Liverpool. Very few wrote “A Day in the Life.”

Moats amplify talent — they don’t replace it.

---

## 2. The “monks and the printing press” analogy

You’re invoking Johannes Gutenberg, and it’s a good instinct.

When the printing press arrived:

* Scribes lost exclusivity.
* Literacy exploded.
* The Church lost informational control.
* New professions appeared (publishers, editors, printers, journalists).
* Religious wars followed.

It wasn’t just job displacement. It was a reorganization of power.

LLMs feel similar. Not because they eliminate thinking, but because they:

* Reduce the cost of producing text, code, images.
* Lower the skill floor.
* Shift value from production → distribution → taste → trust.

The monks weren’t replaced by nothing. They were replaced by printing houses.
Knowledge work isn’t disappearing — it’s being industrialized.

---

## 3. What happened to the photo labs and typesetters?

When digital photography killed film processing:

* Minilab operators disappeared.
* Kodak collapsed.
* Photoshop designers emerged.
* Instagram influencers emerged.
* Smartphone camera engineers emerged.

The labor didn’t vanish. It migrated.

Same with manual typesetters at places like The New York Times. Desktop publishing software wiped out an entire craft. But it created layout designers, digital editors, web developers.

Technology rarely erases value creation.
It redistributes it violently.

---

## 4. Is John Lennon a hypocrite?

Let’s take “Imagine.”

Why is it great, concretely?

* **Harmonic simplicity.** It’s built around a descending piano progression that feels inevitable.
* **Melodic accessibility.** You can sing it badly and it still works.
* **Lyrical ambiguity.** It’s utopian but non-specific — people project onto it.
* **Vocal intimacy.** Lennon sings it almost conversationally.
* **Repetition.** “You may say I’m a dreamer…” anchors it.

Now the hypocrisy charge.

Yes — Lennon benefited massively from copyright law. He sang about a borderless, religion-less world while collecting royalties inside a legal framework backed by the state.

You’re not the first to notice that tension. Critics have long pointed out that utopian artists often operate within — and benefit from — the systems they critique.

But there are two counterpoints:

1. Artists often critique systems while surviving inside them.
2. “Imagine” is aspirational, not policy detail.

He didn’t sing “imagine there’s no IP.” But if there were no IP, would “Imagine” have been written? Or would fewer professional musicians have survived long enough to refine that craft?

IP is a moat. It protects creators.
It also creates inequality.

That tension isn’t hypocrisy so much as paradox.

---

## 5. Avatar and the collapsing production moat

For decades, James Cameron’s moat was:

* Capital
* VFX infrastructure
* Massive crews
* Theater distribution

AI video models threaten the *production* moat.
But they don’t eliminate:

* Taste
* Narrative coherence
* Cultural timing
* Marketing scale
* Audience trust

Even if anyone can generate an “Avatar-level” visual in 2030, not everyone will generate cultural gravity.

The moat may shift from **tools → audience aggregation**.

---

## 6. WordPress and the Gutenberg irony

You’re probably thinking of Matt Mullenweg and WordPress.

WordPress democratized publishing. It absolutely smashed the traditional print moat.

But what happened?

* Millions of blogs.
* Most unread.
* A few dominant platforms (Medium, Substack, YouTube).
* Algorithms became the new gatekeepers.

When production democratizes, distribution re-centralizes.

That may be the AI pattern too.

---

## 7. The “moatless world” — utopia or chaos?

Imagine a world with minimal moats:

* Anyone can generate music at Beatles-level production.
* Anyone can generate films at Cameron-level spectacle.
* Anyone can write at NYT-level polish.
* Anyone can code at senior engineer level.

What becomes scarce?

* Attention
* Authenticity
* Live presence
* Human connection
* Reputation
* Community

The moat shifts from *making things* to *being someone people care about*.

In that world:

* Buskers might thrive more than studio artists.
* Local communities might matter more than global fame.
* Royalties may shrink; patronage may grow.
* “Vibe” becomes more important than polish.

It could be vibrant.
It could also be brutally competitive.

Moatless doesn’t mean egalitarian. It often means winner-take-all at the attention layer.

---

## 8. About the cinema panic analogy

You’re referring to early screenings by the Lumière brothers in Lyon, where audiences supposedly ducked when a train appeared onscreen.

It’s a great metaphor:

New medium appears → panic → normalization → integration into daily life.

AI may follow that arc.

The COVID analogy implies rupture and trauma.
The cinema analogy implies shock and adaptation.

The printing press analogy implies systemic upheaval lasting centuries.

Which one fits? Possibly all three, at different scales.

---

# Now: the style of your “Brodburger” article

It works because:

### 1. It starts with mystery.

Fairy lights in the cold. A question: what keeps people there?

### 2. It escalates curiosity.

Rumors. World-famous chef. Blue cheese.

### 3. It’s embodied.

Cold fingers. Motely blokes. Beanied regular. Dialogue.

### 4. It anthropomorphizes.

“Gypsy magic.” “Pact with the devil.”

### 5. It closes wide.

It zooms from burger → Canberra’s cultural identity.

It works emotionally because it:

* Moves from curiosity → enchantment → cultural significance.
* Makes a small thing feel symbolic.
* Uses humor to soften seriousness.

It’s persuasive without lecturing.

It’s good because it trusts the reader to infer meaning.

---

# Headline ideas (tweetable, “-gate” energy)

Some “Watergate”-style riffs you asked for:

* **Moatgate**
* **NoMoat**
* **Beatlegate**
* **ImagineGate**
* **Moatless**
* **The Great Unmoating**
* **The Moat Collapse**
* **The Gutenberging**
* **Printing Press 2.0**
* **Everyone Is Google Now**
* **Artists Have No Moat**
* **The End of the Abbey Road Era**
* **The Last Knowledge Worker**

If you want something sharp:

* **“We Have No Moat” — Now Neither Do You**
* **The Great Unmoating**
* **From Abbey Road to Anywhere**
* **When Everyone Has Abbey Road in Their Pocket**

---

# If you wrote this as a Brodburger-style piece

You wouldn’t start with policy.

You’d start with a scene.

Maybe:

* A coder alone at 2am.
* A designer watching Midjourney generate in seconds what took her days.
* A busker fined for singing “Imagine.”
* A film student typing a prompt and watching a dragon lift off.

You’d let the fairy lights be the GPU glow.

You’d build mystery:

“What could possibly be keeping all these knowledge workers staring into the glow of their screens?”

Then widen the lens:

“Maybe Google wasn’t the only one without a moat.”

---

If you’d like, I can draft a full short article in that Brodburger style — same length, narrative arc, ending on a cultural zoom-out.

Would you prefer:

1. Hopeful tone?
2. Ominous tone?
3. Ironic/sardonic?
4. Balanced but punchy?

And do you want Lennon explicitly in it, or just implied?
