# Prompt 1
## Artists Have No Moat
There was a famous leaked email from google "we have no moat" when OpenAI "made google dance" by having release ChatGPT ahead of any of their AI products.
I think its the case now that its not only Google that has no moat (although I think they have rebuilt theirs a bit) but its all "knowledge workers" in general that have "no moat".
I think its interesting to first consider a few example of "moats" that were existing for artists and other people. 
Did the Beatles have a moat?
I think of the black and white footage I've seen of young Beatles fans going really wild for them... 1000s of people just crazy about 4 guys... its a real exclusivity dynamic. And I want to believe as some people say "talent doesn't exist"... these were just 4 average guys, in the right place at the right time doing the right amount of work. I say in the right place at the right time meaning that access to recording studios was pretty limited. Its not like today where anyone can make a really high quality recording in their own home, maybe even with just a readily available smart phone... (this sounds similar to the Apollo spacecraft analogy - we have more computing power available in our pockets than was needed to successfully land on the moon... so that was one of the aspects of the 'space travel moat' that has been bridged, I think the space travel moat is still very intact though as it takes a lot of resources to leave earth orbit (right?)). 
So you had these four average young guys who somehow got access to the recording studios and were then able to mass produce 7 inch singles or whatever product it was to a huge audience... you had this new "consumption dynamic" that was put in place. Now the music industry is a completely transformed landscape due to things like readily available recording equipment and the internet for distribution to a potentially even larger audience... and most of the time its not behind a 'pay wall' or physical record shop counter where there has to be money exchanged as part of the distribution.
Sometimes I think a good analogy of the current LLM revolution is that there were a lot of people who were working like the monks who hand copied bibles... working away all day in their "cells"... and then gutenberg and the printing press came along, and suddenly you didn't need all those monks any more. Do you think that's kind of accurate? What do you call it? LLMs? Machine Learning? AI? Whatever you call it, its like a new form of printing press or a new media like photography or cinema was which completely distorts the pre-existing landscapes.
And we may think that our jobs are safe, but have a look at what happened to the photo shops and chemists where you used to be able to get your camera film developed... I think the real picture is that there are a lot of us working in film processing labs without necessarily realising it. 
But ok, its not all bad right? Like I didn't see protests and a massive economic impact after the photo labs closed... or was there? What did all these people do?
I also saw another documentary about the last manual typesetters working at the New York Times newspaper. Changes in technology meant they retrained and got other jobs... or did they? Was that all bad news?
I mean is there that one man creator of WordPress? He's like a bit of a gutenberg guy right? Because he opened up self publishing to a previously unimagined set of people? Much less need for a traditional press right?

Now this is being really honest but I've always had a little beef with John Lennon. His song 'imagine'... its a fantastic song... I mean its really great (what are some of the concrete reasons is it so great?)... but I have often thought... its trying to get you to imagine this really utopian world and yet if I were to go out into the street and busk with this song to make enough money to eat dinner I could potentially be fined or called a criminal, right? I don't believe there's a line in the song that says "imagine there's no intellectual property" or "imagine there's no private property", but aren't these two of the things that would be really holding back Lennon's imagined utopia. And he seems to have the nerve to sing all of that from the comfort of a mansion (I heard a story he asked his gardener to only grow white roses or something, and he laid in bed all day or something)... I would love to lay in bed all day but unfortunately I would soon starve. It seems to be me part of the reason he was able to lay in bed was because he was recieving royalties from songs like imagine... lots and lots of royalities. Can you see the hypocracy in that or am I missing something? Has someone else made this point much better than me?

Anyway, John Lennon also had a moat. His intellectual property moat (or all those laws that hold that system up... laws that are fundamentally back by violence - right?). 

Another moat is the Avatar thing... before you needed to be James Cameron with millions of dollars to produce a movie on the level of Avatar. But I think possibly within a few years this will be vastly more accessible and anyone who can type out a story prompt in enough detail and can afford to pay the inference for the video model could produce a film of similar quality.

So the artists lose their traditional moat but the upside is that 'everyday people' have more creative opportunities. Can we imagine a world without the moats or with way less of them. Can we imagine a *great* world without the moats? What would this look like?

I would love to turn these ideas into a punchy short article... something with a tweetable headline that speaks directly to that google-no-moat idea... in the way that people sometimes say variations on 'watergate' to get the message across that we are dealing with a similar thing (could you give me a few of those examples)? 
I would like the article/piece to be in the style of an article I'm attaching below... like I guess similar length and similar story telling style. Do you think you could give an analysis of that article's style and story telling style... like how would you describe the way it works on the reader and whether you think its good or not.

I would also like you to consider the article written by Matt Shumer here: https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening I don't know if the Covid analogy is the best here because I feel that things have kind of gone back to a reasonable normal since... I wonder if the invention of the cinema in Lyon would be a better analogy. I thought I heard a story that people ran out of the first cinemas in fear that a train was going to run over them. And now life has pretty much gone back to normal... the cinema is part of our everyday lives.

Anyway I would appreciate your thoughts on all this. Thanks!

# An ode to the Brodburger

Driving past late on cold Canberra nights I’d seen those caravan fairy lights. In their faint glow between the trees they half-illuminated a mystery. What could possibly be keep all those people standing out there in the freezing cold by this forgotten corner of Lake Burley Griffin?

I reasoned it must be some illegal gambling setup or a bizarre old-timers night-sailing club. Driving past another night with a friend I got more of the story: “Apparently, he’s a world famous chef, but now he only does burgers. Does ’em with blue cheese and brie and stuff – they’re meant to be really good. That’s what keeps the people standing out there.”

Curious to find out more, last Friday night I finally got my chance. Accessing the place is a challenge in itself – you have to approach from the right direction, but beware: once you find that turn-off, your life may change forever. I parked the car amongst the healthy crowd of others, still shaking my head as to how this place, miles from any movie theatres, shops or heating could draw a crowd at this hour. Getting out and edging my way into the huddle standing around the caravan I could tell I was impinging on a new culture with already established customs.

“Are you guys in line?” I gingerly asked the motley assembly of mostly blokes who looked as if they’d done this all before

“Line? Nah mate, there’s none of that… you’ve just gotta use the force or something. You’ll get the hang of it.”

There was something bizarre about this power dynamic. A group of half freezing guys staring into a cosy looking gypsy cabin, waiting on salvation.

I squinted to make out the menu. “Listen,” a beanied regular advised me, “if it’s your first time you’ll probably want to start with a blue cheese Brodburger, then you can work you way through the other options from there”.

Obviously he thought I’d be back to brave the cold again. “Look mate, it’s not uncommon for first-timers to score a Brodtrick off the bat”. “A Brod-trick?” I stammered. “Yeah”, he chuckled to his mate, “three nights in a row!”

It’s not only blokes who seem to be mad about these burgers. Another shiverer confided: “Every time I drive past here with my wife, she laments that we’ve just eaten, or that it’s not dinner-time. Now I have to bring the burgers back to her while she waits where it’s warm”.

The place was certainly getting a good rap from customers. Surveying the crowd of a dozen or so, you could see that underneath their veneer of blokey stoicness, these guys seemed almost proud of something. Jumping out of the caravan to grab more bread rolls out of his car, I took my chance to encounter the man behind operation that so fascinated me.

“I guess you must be Brod”, I tried unconvincingly.

His warm response seemed to wash away any nervousness I had. “Yeah, I am. Sasha actually. Sasha Brodbeck”.

Sporting only a black T-shirt against the cold, his relaxed and friendly manner seemed to draw me further into the enchantment of the place. I had time to learn that he’d had the place open just 4 months before he quickly jumped back behind the grill to keep up with the run of orders.

It was then however that the magic of that gypsy caravan really kicked into overdrive. “Right, is anyone waiting to order?” called the girl from inside, flicking a curl of black hair out of her equally dark eyes. It was my turn.

Her manner, her smile, the way she threw off the cajoling of the onlooking guys… everything was perfect. I wanted to film the Australian version of American Graffiti right there and then. There were no cash registers, no eftpos or state of the art ordering systems, or slick café fit-outs. It’s was just good old fashioned “show me the money and I’ll show you the burger”.

I briefly wondered if it was all a carefully engineered marketing scheme – did she hand me the free chips just to be nice, or could she tell I was fresh meat, the only customer she hadn’t seen before. Maybe there is a dark secret.

I can just imagine a black t-shirt clad Sasha making his pact with the devil, securing his place in the hearts of Canberran’s over the souls of a few hapless bovine beasts. Or maybe it’s just that there is some kind of gypsy caravan magic powering those fairy lights. In any case, it didn’t matter now, I was firmly under the Brodburger spell.

Enchanted.

My number is called and she hands over my burgers. I seem to be the last customer around, but someone who’s just a bit too far from the fairylight glow pipes up that he’s still waiting.

A contented but shivering burger-eater jokes “If you think they’re too slow, McDonalds is just down the road!” Everyone laughs, but behind the joke seems to lurk a threat: “Just you go and try it, punk”.

Somehow the fairylights and the fabled burgers have formed a faithful brotherhood. Going anywhere else is the last thing anyone has on their mind. It’s as if the wait in the cold is a test of the burger-eater’s mettle.

Sasha takes advantage of the lull in business to get out from behind the grill and light a cigarette. It’s 8pm and the night still feels young, although quite bitterly cold. As I walk away, burger in hand, I think it might be a lonely stretch for him from here till the end of the night. But before the thought has time to finish, a gang of six sports bikes roars in. Parking right up near the caravan, they are cursing and joking as they take off their helmets.

Where they have been sounds exciting – I’m almost tempted to lurk in the caravan light to glean some details of their exploits. Sasha stamps his cigarette out and jumps back behind the grill. Obviously they knew about this spot. Maybe they fell under caravan’s spell just like me.

Whether he has engineered it or not – Sasha Brodburg has created a real place. A place that will put Canberra on the map much more than the latest architectural masterpiece or grand monument. He, along with Bibimbap’s at Korean student joints and friendly staff at the Dendy cinemas are slowly giving Canberra what it’s been lacking for so long: the special sauce that Burley Griffin, no matter how meticulous he was, couldn’t fit into his plan.

Regardless of how good the burgers are (and you’ll have to judge them for yourselves), Brodburg should already be unanimously celebrated for that.

Driving away with my hard-won burger by my side, my thoughts run-riot about what summer may hold for Sasha and his caravan.

For him and for Canberra, I hope the gypsy magic of those fairy lights lasts a little longer.

August 2009



# Response 1
What a rich set of ideas to dig into! Let me work through this systematically before we get to the article itself.

**On the Matt Shumer piece first:**Good, I've read the Shumer piece. Now let me pull together my thoughts on everything and give you a proper response.

---

## On the Shumer piece

Your instinct about the Covid analogy is right, and the cinema analogy is better. Covid's defining feature was *reversal* — it felt enormous, then life substantially normalized. That's the opposite of what you're arguing. The cinema is perfect precisely because people *did* run from the first Lumière screenings in Lyon (1895) in genuine fear, and now projectors hum away in every suburb without anyone noticing. The technology became so integrated it disappeared. That's the trajectory you're describing — not a crisis that fades, but a disruption that becomes ambient.

The Shumer piece itself is well-written and genuinely alarming, but it has a structural problem: it wants to be both an intimate personal letter ("I'm writing this for my family") and a comprehensive policy document. It ends up doing neither quite as well as it might. It's also very software-engineering-centric — his own field. Your framing is actually more interesting because it's *cultural* and *historical* rather than technical.

## On the Lennon / Imagine hypocrisy

You're not the first to notice this, and you've landed on something real. The academic philosopher and activist **Slavoj Žižek** has made a version of this point — that "Imagine" performs radical politics from a position of extreme privilege, asking listeners to *imagine* giving up possessions while the singer sits behind his own considerable wall of property and IP rights. 

What makes the song great despite this? A few concrete reasons:
- The melody is almost arithmetically simple — stepwise motion, almost no leaps — which makes it feel like a lullaby, disarming resistance before the lyrics land
- It uses the word *imagine* as a repeated invitation rather than a command, which keeps you on-side emotionally
- The production is stripped — just piano and voice for the opening — which creates intimacy and sincerity, whatever the biographical reality
- It asks you to *feel* a vision rather than argue for it, which is rhetorically very powerful

The hypocrisy is real but it's also arguably baked into the art itself — the gap between the song's vision and Lennon's life is so large it becomes almost a feature rather than a bug. He was selling you a dream he couldn't live himself. Which is, you could argue, what most utopian art does.

---

## On the "Watergate -gate" construction

You asked for examples of that pattern — taking a proper noun and appending it to signal "scandal of this type":
- **Irangate / Contragate** (Iran-Contra affair)
- **Monicagate** (Clinton-Lewinsky)
- **Gamergate** (online harassment campaign in gaming)
- **Deflategate** (NFL ball-pressure scandal)
- **Partygate** (UK Covid parties at Downing Street)

The pattern you want is slightly different — not "scandal" but "disruption of the same structural kind." The Google memo was called the "Google has no moat" memo, which already has traction. Your angle is: *what the monks felt when Gutenberg arrived.*

---

## Style analysis of the Brodburger piece

This is really good writing, and it's worth unpacking *why* it works before you try to imitate the register.

The piece operates through **mystery, then revelation, then belonging**. It opens with the narrator as an outsider — confused, slightly suspicious ("some illegal gambling setup") — and lets the reader experience discovery *alongside* them rather than being told what to think. The writer never says "this is a great burger joint." You feel it through accumulation of observed detail.

The voice is **conversational but precise**. "A contented but shivering burger-eater" — that's a good sentence. The comedy is dry and understated. The writer is clearly charmed but maintains just enough ironic distance not to gush.

It uses **social texture** brilliantly — the beanied regular, the motley assembly of blokes, the sports bikes roaring in. You feel the micro-culture forming around the caravan in real time.

The ending earns its sentimentality because the whole piece has been *earned* through observation rather than assertion. "I hope the gypsy magic of those fairy lights lasts a little longer" works because you've been in that caravan light with the writer for 800 words.

**What makes it different from standard food writing**: most food writing describes food. This piece barely describes the burger at all. The burger is almost a MacGuffin — it's really about community, surprise, and the particular Canberra magic of finding something special in an unlikely place.

---

## Now — the article

I'd suggest matching the Brodburger's **length** (roughly 700-900 words), its **first-person discovery structure**, its **light ironic touch**, and its habit of arriving at the bigger idea through the specific and observed rather than the abstract and declared. 

Here's a draft:

**Artists Have No Moat**

I keep thinking about the monks.

Not in any romantic way — just the image of them, bent over their desks in those cold scriptoria, copying out bibles by hand. Years of work. The scratching of quills, the careful illumination of capitals, the slow accumulation of a single book that might take a lifetime. Then Gutenberg arrives with his press, and almost overnight, the thing that made them irreplaceable — their patience, their craft, their exclusive access to the means of production — just evaporates.

I wonder if any of them saw it coming. Probably not. Probably they assumed that something so central to how civilization transmitted knowledge would require human hands forever.

We all assume that about our own hands.

---

Here's a thought experiment. Did the Beatles have a moat?

Watch the old footage — those black-and-white reels of teenagers losing their minds outside concert halls. Thousands of people, genuinely wild, for four ordinary blokes from Liverpool. Part of what we're watching isn't just talent or charisma. It's *scarcity*. Recording studios in the early sixties were rare, expensive, and guarded. Getting into one, making something the world could actually hear, required access that almost nobody had. The Beatles happened to get that access at the exact moment when a new mass-consumption system — the 7-inch single, the transistor radio, the screaming teenager — was being assembled around them.

Talent, yes. But also: the right place, the right time, and an exclusive key to a room most people couldn't enter.

That room is now everyone's bedroom. Anyone with a phone and a free afternoon can make a recording that would have required Abbey Road in 1963. The studio moat has been drained.

---

Something similar is happening now, faster and stranger than anything since Gutenberg, and most of us are only dimly aware of it — the way you might be dimly aware that the water is rising while you're busy checking your email.

The Google memo that leaked a few years ago — "We Have No Moat" — was executives panicking about their own competitive position against open-source AI. But the more I think about it, the more I think the memo wasn't really about Google. It was about all of us. Every knowledge worker who assumed that what they do — write, design, analyse, create — required a kind of training and access and apprenticeship that couldn't simply be replicated. Every one of us was quietly relying on our own version of the same moat.

The monks had the scriptoria. The Beatles had Abbey Road. James Cameron had $300 million and an army of visual effects artists. We had our expertise, our years of experience, our particular way of doing things. These were real. They still are — for now.

---

I think about the photo labs.

Not in any aggressively political way, but just practically: there were thousands of people whose entire livelihood was developing camera film. They had skills. They had equipment. They had loyal customers who came every week with their rolls of holiday snaps. Then digital cameras arrived, then smartphones, and the whole ecosystem just stopped needing them. No one organised a global protest. The labs closed quietly. The people found other things to do — or they didn't, and we just didn't hear much about that part.

The question that keeps nagging at me is: did they see it coming? And if they had, would it have made any difference?

---

Here's where it gets interesting, though — and I don't want to skip this part, because most of the conversation gets stuck in the anxious bit and never makes it through to the other side.

The same printing press that put the monks out of work eventually put a bible in every home. The same photography that killed portrait painting gave us Cartier-Bresson and Dorothea Lange and a billion family memories stored in shoeboxes under beds. Every time a moat gets drained, a flood of new creative possibility comes rushing in behind it.

The Avatar moat — the idea that you needed James Cameron money to make James Cameron films — is going. Within a few years, anyone who can describe a story in enough detail may be able to produce something visually indistinguishable from a major studio release. That sounds terrifying from one angle. From another, it's the most democratising thing that's happened to storytelling since the paperback book.

John Lennon sang *imagine there's no possessions* from a large house in Manhattan where, I've heard, he requested only white flowers in the garden. There's an irony there that nobody missed, but perhaps the more interesting thing is this: the royalties that let him lie in bed all day were themselves a moat. Intellectual property law, backed ultimately by the kind of enforcement mechanisms you'd rather not think about too hard, was what converted a song into a recurring income. That moat is looking shakier by the day too.

---

Maybe the question isn't whether the moats fall — they clearly do, they always have. The question is what we decide to build once the water's gone.

The monks, after all, didn't disappear. Some of them became editors. Some became teachers. The printing press didn't end the need for people who cared deeply about words — it just changed what caring about words could look like.

I don't know exactly what comes next. Nobody does, which is uncomfortable but also, if you squint at it right, kind of extraordinary.

The water is rising. The press is already running.

What are you going to print?

---

That's roughly 850 words and tries to follow the Brodburger's logic: start specific and grounded, let ideas accumulate through observed examples rather than argument, maintain light irony, and arrive at something genuinely felt rather than merely asserted. Happy to adjust the tone, the ending, the Lennon section (which could be cut if it feels like a detour), or punch up the headline. A few headline options:

- **"Artists Have No Moat"** (clean, direct, already has search resonance from the Google memo)
- **"The Monks Had No Idea"**
- **"We're All Working in the Film Lab"**
- **"The Room Everyone Could Enter"**

The last one's perhaps the most evocative but least immediately searchable. What's your instinct?
