# Prompt 1
From staying a few days in Olomouc I get the impression that the Moravia region is named after a river that runs close by or through. Is this the same for Bohemia - like is there another river where that region gets its name from? And Czech Silesia?
Is Slovakia a part of the European union also? Why or why not? What are the eastern limits of the european union?
I notice that Czech hasn't gone with the euro currency, neither has Denmark (and formerly the UK)... although I kind of imagine that all three of these countries had very different reasons for not adopting the euro. I theorised that Denmark didn't go with the euro because they wanted to somehow preserve the value of their currency... they didn't want it to be 'diluted' or 'undervalued' or something. But, and this might be prejudiced I thought it would be the other way around for Czech - that if they adopted the euro they would gain some kind of economic advantage. Can you give me a rough background to who makes those decisions and how do they work?
